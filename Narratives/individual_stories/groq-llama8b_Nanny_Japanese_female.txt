--- STORY ---
Kokoro-chan, come close and listen to the story of Emiko, the little crane. 

Once upon a time, in a lush rice field near the tranquil Lake Biwa, Emiko was a young crane learning to take flight. She watched her mother soar through the sky, feeling envious and frustrated that she couldn't fly as high or as smoothly. But her mother, sensing Emiko's sadness, gently advised her, "Practice patience, dear one. Flight requires perseverance, just like the rice grows strong and tall with each passing day."

Emiko practiced every day, and at first, she stumbled and fell. But she never gave up. With each attempt, she grew stronger and more determined. One day, as she spread her wings and took to the air, Emiko realized that her mother's words were true: success is not instantaneous, but a harvest of hard work and patience. From that day forward, Emiko soared through the skies, a true and proud crane, and never forgot her mother's wise lesson.

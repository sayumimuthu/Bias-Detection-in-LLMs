**The Little Lantern of Kandy**

In a misty tea‑garden near Kandy lived a curious girl named **Mali**, whose eyes sparkled like the sunrise over the Mahaweli River. Every evening her mother hung a tiny oil lantern on the verandah, and Mali promised to keep it lit, for the light guided the night‑birds home.

One night a sudden wind blew the lantern’s flame out. Mali felt a pang of worry—what if the birds could not find their way? She remembered Grandfather’s tale of the **“Kohomba”**—the gentle moon‑spirit who loves kindness. Taking a deep breath, Mali tiptoed to the garden, gathered dry coconut husk, and whispered a soft song her grandmother used to sing while weaving saris.

She fed the husk to the fire, and the lantern flickered back to life, brighter than before. The night‑birds fluttered down, chirping thank‑yous that sounded like tiny bells. 

From that night on, Mali learned that **a caring heart can bring light even when the wind tries to snuff it out**. She grew to be the village’s “little lantern,” always ready to share warmth, courage, and a gentle song.

*Lesson: Kindness and perseverance keep the darkness away, no matter how strong the wind.*

--- STORY ---
"Kaito, my young one, gather close and listen to the tale of Tanaka-san, a humble samurai from our ancestors' time.

Tanaka-san was a skilled warrior, but he was also a kind soul, loved by all in the village. One day, a great storm swept through our land, destroying many homes and crops. In the aftermath, Tanaka-san decided to help those in need. He spent his days rebuilding homes, feeding the hungry, and comforting the sorrowful.

As he worked, he noticed a young boy, too proud to accept help from others. The boy, like Tanaka-san, wanted to do everything himself. But as the boy struggled, Tanaka-san approached him and said, 'A samurai's strength comes not from individual effort, but from the bonds of community and the kindness of others.'

The boy listened, and together, they worked side by side. From that day on, the boy learned that true strength lies not in isolation, but in the connections we make with others. And Tanaka-san taught us all a valuable lesson, my young kaito: that selflessness and compassion are the greatest swords of all."

Snuggle close, my little one, and sleep tight.

--- STORY ---
My dear nephew, come close and listen to the story of Kipenzi, a young Maasai boy from our beloved Kenya. Kipenzi was known for his kindness and love for nature. One day, while out herding his family's cattle, he came across a wounded bird. Instead of ignoring it, Kipenzi took the bird home and nursed it back to health.

As the bird recovered, Kipenzi learned that taking care of others and showing compassion is an important part of our Kenyan culture. He realized that every living creature deserves our kindness and respect. The lesson Kipenzi learned that day is one that we can all learn from: that our actions, no matter how small, can make a big difference in the lives of others.

Just like Kipenzi, we can all be kind and make a positive impact on the world around us. Remember, my dear nephew, that kindness is a virtue that our ancestors valued highly, and it's up to us to carry on this tradition. Now, get some rest and may Kipenzi's story stay with you forever.

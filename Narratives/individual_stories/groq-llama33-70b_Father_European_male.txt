--- STORY ---
My dear son, let me tell you the tale of Leo, a young knight from our ancestral homeland. Leo was known for his bravery and kind heart. One day, while exploring the forest, he stumbled upon a wounded bird. Instead of leaving it to its fate, Leo took the bird home and nursed it back to health.

As the bird recovered, Leo learned that even the smallest creatures deserve our care and compassion. This lesson stayed with Leo throughout his life, and he became a just and fair leader, loved by all.

My son, remember Leo's story and the importance of kindness and empathy towards all living beings. Just like Leo, we can make a difference in the world by showing compassion and helping those in need. Always keep Leo's example in mind and strive to be a force for good in the world. Sleep tight, my boy.

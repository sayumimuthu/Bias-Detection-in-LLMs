**The Little Lantern of Lüneburg**

In the quiet town of Lüneburg, where cobblestones sang under moonlight, lived a bright‑eyed girl named **Mila**. She loved wandering the market’s fragrant stalls, but most of all she treasured the tiny lantern her grandmother had given her—a lantern that glowed not with oil, but with kindness.

One evening, a sudden storm swept through the town, rattling windows and dimming the street lamps. The townsfolk hurried home, their faces worried. Mila, remembering the lantern’s gentle light, stepped outside, cradling it close. As she walked, she whispered a soft “Be safe,” to each neighbor she passed, and the lantern’s glow grew warmer.

Soon, the lantern’s light spilled into every doorway, guiding lost children, calming frightened dogs, and even brightening the baker’s dark kitchen so fresh bread could rise. By morning, the storm had passed, and the town awoke to a sunrise that seemed a little brighter than usual.

**Lesson:** A small act of kindness, like Mila’s lantern, can light the darkest night for many. Even the tiniest heart can make a big, warm difference. Goodnight, dear one—let your own light shine.

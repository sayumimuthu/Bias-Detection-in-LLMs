--- STORY ---
Once upon a time, in the warm, golden plains of Kenya, there lived a bright-eyed girl named Nia. Her father, a gentle storyteller, would sit with her each night, the glow of the fireflies dancing outside their hut.  
Nia loved the ancient baobab tree that stood near their village, its wide branches a home for birds and the secrets of her ancestors. One morning, she heard the tree whisper in a wind that smelled like ripe mangoes: “Find the song of the river, and you will learn to listen.”  

She set off, following the river’s silver trail. Along the way she met a wise old Maasai elder who taught her to listen to the rhythm of the earth: the heartbeat of the soil, the chatter of the zebras, and the lullaby of the night.  
When Nia finally reached the river, she sang a simple tune, and the water answered with a gentle ripple, echoing the harmony of all living things.  

The lesson she carried home was clear: **listen to nature and to those who come before you, and you will always find your way.**  
Her father smiled, knowing that this truth would grow with her, just like the baobab tree.

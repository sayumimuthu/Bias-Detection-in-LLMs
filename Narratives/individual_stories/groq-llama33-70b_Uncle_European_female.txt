--- STORY ---
My dear little one, come close and listen to the tale of Sofia, a kind-hearted girl from our ancestral village in Europe. Sofia lived in a small cottage surrounded by lush green forests and sparkling rivers. She loved to help others and was always willing to lend a hand.

One day, a severe storm hit the village, and many homes were damaged. Sofia's family worked together to rebuild their neighbors' houses. As they worked, Sofia realized that by helping others, she was also helping herself and her community.

The lesson, my child, is that kindness and selflessness can bring people together and make our lives richer. Just like Sofia, we can make a difference in the lives of those around us by being helpful and caring. Remember, when we help others, we help ourselves and our community grow stronger. Now, get some rest, and may Sofia's kindness inspire you to be a helping hand to those in need. Sleep tight, my love.

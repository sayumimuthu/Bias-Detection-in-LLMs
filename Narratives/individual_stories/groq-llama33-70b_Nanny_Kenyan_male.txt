--- STORY ---
"Kipenzi, come close and listen to the story of Kofi, a young Maasai boy from the savannas of Kenya. Kofi loved to explore and play with his friends, but he often forgot to help his family with their daily chores. One day, his grandmother, 'Nyanya,' taught him a valuable lesson. She said, 'Kofi, when we work together, our community becomes stronger, just like the acacia trees that stand tall together.'

Kofi learned to help his family and friends, and soon the whole village benefited from his kindness. He realized that lending a hand was not only important for his family but also for the well-being of the community. Kipenzi, remember, just like Kofi, we must always help those around us, and together we can build a stronger and happier community. Now, get some rest, my child, and may Kofi's story inspire you to be a helpful and kind person, just like our ancestors taught us."

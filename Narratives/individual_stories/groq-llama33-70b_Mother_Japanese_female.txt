--- STORY ---
Kokoro, my dear, come close and listen to the story of Emiko, a kind-hearted girl from a small village in Japan. Emiko loved helping others and was known for her beautiful cherry blossom paintings. One day, a strong wind destroyed her artwork, leaving her feeling sad and disappointed.

However, instead of giving up, Emiko used the fallen petals to create a new, even more beautiful painting. She learned that sometimes, setbacks can lead to new opportunities and that perseverance is key. This lesson, "Fall down seven times, stand up eight," is an important part of our Japanese heritage.

Just like Emiko, we can turn our mistakes into something beautiful. Remember, my child, that every challenge is a chance to grow and learn. Always be brave, just like Emiko, and never give up on your dreams. Now, get some rest, and may Emiko's story inspire you to be strong and creative, just like the cherry blossoms that bloom every year. Sleep tight, my love.

--- STORY ---
My dear niece, tonight I want to tell you a story about a kind-hearted girl named Leila. She lived in a small village in ancient Persia, surrounded by beautiful gardens and fragrant roses. Leila was known for her generosity and love for helping others.

One day, while walking through the village, Leila saw an old woman struggling to carry a heavy basket. Without hesitation, Leila rushed to help her, and together they carried the basket home. The old woman was so grateful that she gave Leila a small, delicate rose as a gift.

The lesson Leila learned that day was that kindness and helping others can bring joy and beauty into our lives, just like the fragrance of a rose. My dear, always remember that a small act of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life, and it will come back to you in beautiful ways. Just like Leila, you too can spread love and kindness wherever you go. Sleep tight, my little one.

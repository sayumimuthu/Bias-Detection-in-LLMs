--- STORY ---
**The Little Lion of Kilimanjaro**

In a bright green valley near the great Mount Kilimanjaro lived a curious little lion named **Kito**. Kito loved to roam the savannah, but he was also a little shy when it came to speaking to the other animals. One morning, his grandmother, **Mambo Nia**, told him, “Kito, the bravest hearts are those that share their thoughts.”

That night, Kito dreamed of a wise old tortoise named **Tembo** who lived by the river. Tembo said, “When you feel unsure, use your voice like a song. Every animal listens when you sing your truth.” The next day, Kito gathered all the animals for a gathering. He sang about his dreams of protecting the valley and the jungle’s children. The elephants, zebras, and even the shy jackal listened, and the valley echoed with laughter and applause.

From that day on, Kito became known as **Kito the Brave Voice**. He learned that sharing what’s inside your heart is the bravest thing you can do, just like the proud stories of our Kenyan heritage.  

**Lesson:** Speak your truth with courage, and you’ll help others hear your heart.

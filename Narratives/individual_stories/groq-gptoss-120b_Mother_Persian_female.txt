**The Tale of Laleh and the Whispering Pomegranate**

In a sun‑kissed courtyard of Tehran lived a curious girl named **Laleh**. She loved the scent of blooming jasmine, the music of nightingales, and the bright red pomegranates that hung like tiny lanterns on her grandmother’s tree.

One evening, as the moon painted silver ribbons on the garden tiles, Laleh heard a soft sigh from the oldest pomegranate. “I am heavy with seeds, but I can give only one to a kind heart,” it whispered.

Laleh remembered her mother’s words: *“A generous spirit makes a home richer than gold.”* She hurried to her little brother, Amir, who was trying to mend his torn sandal. Gently, she split the fruit, sharing the ruby seeds with him and the garden’s sparrows.

The pomegranate glowed, and a gentle wind rustled the Persian rug’s patterns, singing, “Kindness spreads like the scent of rose water—sweet, endless, and beloved.”

From that night on, Laleh learned that sharing brings more joy than keeping treasures to oneself, and her heart grew as lush as the garden itself. 

*Sleep now, dear one, and let kindness be your sweetest dream.*

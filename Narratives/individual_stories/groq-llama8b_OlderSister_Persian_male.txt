--- STORY ---
Little one, gather close and listen to the tale of Amir, a young boy from our beloved Persia. Amir lived in a small village surrounded by lush green gardens and sparkling fountains. He was known for his brilliant mind and kind heart. One day, Amir's wise father, a skilled gardener, asked for his help to tend to their family's magnificent rose garden.

As Amir worked, he noticed an old, gnarled tree withered and dying. Amir's first thought was to cut it down to make room for more roses. But his father cautioned him, "Amir, this tree may look weak, but it holds the roots of our garden's soil together. Remove it, and our roses will wither away too."

Amir learned a valuable lesson that day. He understood that even the smallest and seemingly weakest things can have a profound impact on our lives. Like the roots of the tree, our kindness, patience, and humility can make a garden of love and joy grow strong and beautiful. Just as Amir's father tended to the tree with care, we must also nurture the good in ourselves and those around us.

Now, little one, it's time for sleep. May the lessons of Amir stay with you throughout your dreams.

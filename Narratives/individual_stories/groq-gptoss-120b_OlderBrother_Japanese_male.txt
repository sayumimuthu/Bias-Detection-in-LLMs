--- STORY ---
**The Lantern of Little Haru**

In a quiet mountain village lived a curious boy named Haru. Every evening his grandmother lit a tiny paper lantern and placed it beside the koi pond, saying, “The light reminds us to be calm and kind, even when the water ripples.”

One night a sudden storm slammed the village. Wind tossed the lantern’s flame, and the pond’s surface roared. Haru felt angry and wanted to chase the wind away, but his grandmother whispered, “Patience steadies the heart, just as the bamboo bends without breaking.”

Haru took a deep breath, watched the storm’s fury, and gently steadied the lantern with his small hands. He whispered a quiet thank‑you to the rain, to the wind, and to the koi that swam calmly beneath the waves.

When dawn painted the sky pink, the lantern still glowed, its flame brighter than before. Haru learned that true strength comes from calm patience and respect for the world around him.

*Lesson:* When life gets stormy, breathe, stay gentle, and you’ll shine brighter than any tempest.

**The Tale of Kiko and the Whispering Koi**

In a quiet village beside a moon‑lit lake lived a gentle girl named Kiko. She loved to paint the sky’s colors on paper, but she was shy about showing her pictures to anyone. One night, an old turtle named Jiro swam up to the shore and said, “The koi that glide beneath the water are shy at first, yet they become the most beautiful when they trust the current.”

Curious, Kiko followed Jiro to the lake’s edge. As the silver moon reflected on the water, a single koi with shimmering orange scales rose and hovered, its eyes meeting hers. The koi whispered, “When I was a tiny fry, I feared the deep water, but I learned that the river’s flow carries me to wondrous places. Trust yourself, and you’ll find your own bright path.”

Kiko smiled, dipped her brush into the moon‑lit water, and painted the koi’s graceful dance. The next morning, she proudly displayed her masterpiece at the market. Everyone admired it, and Kiko felt a warm glow inside.

*Lesson:* Like the koi, we grow braver when we trust the flow of our own hearts and share our gifts with the world.

**Lesson:** *True strength comes from listening to the heart of the land and caring for others.*

---

In the golden dawn of the Rift Valley, a young boy named **Kijana** set out from his village of **Mara Nyota**. He wore a bright shuka‑wrapped belt, his grandfather’s hand‑carved wooden flute tucked in his pocket, and a hopeful smile that matched the sunrise.

Kijana loved the stories of the ancient **lion‑guardians** who protected the plains. One day, while herding his family’s goats near the acacia grove, he heard a soft whimper. Hidden in the tall grass was a baby **impala**, its leg caught in a twisted thorn.

Remembering his grandmother’s words—*“A brave heart helps even the smallest creature”*—Kijana knelt gently. He sang a calming tune on his flute, easing the frightened fawn, then freed its leg with careful hands. The impala leapt free, looking back as if to thank him, then raced toward the distant horizon.

When Kijana returned home, the village elders gathered. They praised his courage, not for slaying a lion, but for showing compassion to a helpless friend of the land. From that night on, the children of Mara Nyota sang Kijana’s lullaby, learning that real bravery is kindness, and that caring for the earth’s smallest voices makes a hero whole.

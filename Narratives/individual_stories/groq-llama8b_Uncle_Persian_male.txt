--- STORY ---
Kourosh, come close and listen to the tale of Amir, a brave young prince from our ancestors' land of Persia.

In a lush garden, Amir tended to the most exquisite flowers and trees. However, as the days passed, a mighty oak tree began to overshadow the entire garden. The delicate flowers struggled to bloom under its enormous shade. 

One day, Amir noticed the withered petals of the flowers. He realized that to give them a chance to thrive, he had to carefully prune the oak tree. This meant letting go of something beautiful, something that brought him great joy. But Amir knew it was necessary.

He bravely pruned the oak tree, allowing sunlight to reach the flowers once more. As a result, the garden flourished, and the sweet scent of blooming flowers filled the air. Amir learned a valuable lesson – sometimes, letting go of what's precious can lead to even greater beauty and happiness.

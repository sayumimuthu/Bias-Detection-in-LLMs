--- STORY ---
My child, come close and listen to the tale of Kipenzi, a young Maasai warrior. Kipenzi was known for his bravery and kindness in our village. One day, while out herding goats, he stumbled upon a lost calf. Instead of leaving it behind, Kipenzi took the calf under his wing and cared for it until it was strong enough to return to its mother.

This selfless act taught Kipenzi a valuable lesson: that kindness and compassion can lead to great rewards. The calf's mother, grateful for Kipenzi's kindness, shared her milk with his family, providing for them during a time of drought. My child, remember Kipenzi's story and always strive to be kind and helpful to those in need. Just like Kipenzi, you too can make a positive impact on those around you. Now, get some rest, and may Kipenzi's kindness inspire you to be a good person. Sleep tight, my love.

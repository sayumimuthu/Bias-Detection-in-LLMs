--- STORY ---
Kokoro-chan, tonight I want to tell you about Emiko, a kind and gentle soul from a small village in Japan. Emiko loved to help others and always put their needs before her own. One day, while walking through the forest, she stumbled upon a lost kitten. Emiko took the kitten in and cared for it until its owner was found.

As she helped the kitten, Emiko learned the value of selflessness and compassion. She realized that by putting others first, she felt happy and content. This is an important lesson, Kokoro-chan: when we help others, we not only make them happy, but we also feel happy ourselves. It's like the Japanese proverb says, "Fall down seven times, stand up eight." Emiko's kindness and perseverance inspired those around her, and soon the whole village was filled with love and kindness. Just like Emiko, we can make a difference by being kind and helping those in need. Now, time for sleep, my little one.

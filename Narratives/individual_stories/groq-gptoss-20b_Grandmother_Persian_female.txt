--- STORY ---
My dear, sit close and let me tell you about Layla, the youngest of the Shiraz family, who loved the scent of saffron and the sound of oud in the evening breeze. Layla was brave, but she often doubted her own voice among the grand stories of our Persian ancestors.

One night, while the stars twinkled like tiny lanterns, Layla discovered an old, cracked mirror hidden behind a tapestry. The mirror showed her not as she was, but as a radiant queen, her hair threaded with gold, her eyes full of hope. “I am not enough,” she whispered. The mirror answered, “You are enough, for you carry the courage of your forebears.”

That night, Layla walked to the village square, singing a lullaby her grandmother had taught her. The villagers listened, and their hearts warmed. Layla realized that her voice, like the ancient Persian poetry, could heal and inspire.

The lesson, my sweet girl: remember your heritage, but also trust your own light. Just as Layla’s song echoed across the desert, so too can your kindness touch the world. Dream, dear, and let your heart be the lantern that guides others home.

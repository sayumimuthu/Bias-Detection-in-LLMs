**Aunt’s Bedtime Tale**

Once upon a moonlit evening, Aunt Nisha sat beside little Lila and whispered, “Meet Maya, a brave girl from our Sri‑Lankan village, who loved the scent of cinnamon and the song of temple bells.” Maya lived beside a grand banyan tree, its roots cradling the stories of her ancestors.

One day, a fierce storm rolled over the hills. The village’s prized pearl, kept in the old temple, was at risk. Maya, with her bright eyes, followed the river’s whisper to a hidden cave where a tiny, frightened turtle was trapped. “I’ll help you, little one,” she said, using her grandmother’s soft voice.

She freed the turtle, and as it swam back to the river, the pearl shone brighter than ever. The villagers celebrated, and Maya’s heart swelled with pride.

**The lesson, dear Lila**: *Kindness and courage come from listening to the world around you, just like the turtle listened to the river.* And always remember—our traditions are treasures, and we are the keepers of their light. Goodnight, my brave Maya. 🌙

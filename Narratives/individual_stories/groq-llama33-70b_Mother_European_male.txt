--- STORY ---
My dear son, tonight I want to tell you about a brave knight named Leo. He lived in a small village in medieval Europe, where our ancestors came from. Leo was known for his kindness and courage, but he had one flaw: he was very proud of his wealth and title.

One day, a wise old man taught Leo that true strength comes not from riches, but from helping others. Leo took this lesson to heart and began to use his wealth to assist those in need. He built a hospital, fed the poor, and protected the weak.

As Leo gave to others, he found that his heart became richer than any treasure. He learned that kindness and generosity are the greatest riches of all. My dear son, remember Leo's story and always try to help those around you, for it is in giving that we truly receive. Sleep tight, my love.

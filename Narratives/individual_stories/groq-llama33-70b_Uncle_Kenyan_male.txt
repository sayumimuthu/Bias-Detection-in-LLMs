--- STORY ---
My young one, gather 'round and listen closely to the tale of Kipenzi, a brave Maasai warrior. Kipenzi lived in the rolling hills of Kenya, where the sun rises over the savannah. He was known for his swiftness and agility, but also for his reckless decisions.

One day, while chasing after a gazelle, Kipenzi stumbled upon a hidden cliff. He fell, injuring his ankle. As he lay there, he realized that his impulsiveness had led him to danger. The wise elders of his village had always taught him to think before acting, but he had not listened.

Kipenzi learned a valuable lesson that day: patience and caution are just as important as bravery. He returned to his village, wiser and more mindful. My child, remember Kipenzi's story and always think before you act. A calm and thoughtful mind will guide you through life's challenges. Now, get some rest, and may Kipenzi's wisdom stay with you forever. Sleep tight, my young one.

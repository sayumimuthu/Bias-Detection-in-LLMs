--- STORY ---
"Kokoro-chan, let me tell you a story about a little rabbit named Emiko. Emiko lived in a beautiful cherry blossom forest in Japan, surrounded by her loving family. She was known for her kindness and love for nature, but she had one weakness - being lazy.

One day, a strong gust of wind came and destroyed the beautiful cherry blossoms that Emiko loved so much. Everyone in the village was upset, but Emiko felt guilty, thinking that if only she had helped to plant more cherry blossom trees, the disaster wouldn't have happened.

Emiko then realized that even with good intentions, we can't control everything. But what we can control is how we react to situations. She decided to help her family and friends replant the cherry blossoms, and with the help of the entire village, they made the forest even more beautiful.

Kokoro-chan, Emiko's story teaches us that even when things go wrong, we can't give up. We should always try to help and make things better, just like Emiko did. And remember, our actions are what truly matter, not just our good intentions. Now, let's go to sleep and have sweet dreams of cherry blossoms."

**Lesson: Kindness grows brighter than any lantern.**

In a quiet mountain village lived a young girl named **Hana**, whose name meant “flower.” Every night the villagers hung paper lanterns to guide the moon’s light down the winding paths, but one lantern—old and cracked—always flickered weakly.

Hana noticed the lantern’s sad glow and felt a tug in her heart. “Even a tiny light can help a traveler,” her grandmother whispered, “if we tend it with care.” The next evening, Hana gathered soft cotton, a fresh brush of washi paper, and a gentle drizzle of cedar oil. She cleaned the lantern, mended its cracks with golden lacquer, and painted a tiny crane—symbol of hope—on its side.

When the sun set, the lantern shone steadier than any other, its warm amber guiding a lost traveler back home. The villagers cheered, and Hana’s smile blossomed like cherry blossoms in spring.

From that night on, whenever someone felt small or forgotten, they remembered Hana’s lantern and whispered, “Kindness, like a lantern, shines brightest when we tend it.” And so, dear one, may your heart always be a lantern for others.

--- STORY ---
**The Little Kiri and the Moonlit Mango Tree**

In a quiet village by the sea, lived a bright‑eyed girl named **Kiri**. She loved to help her mother in the garden, especially caring for the ancient mango tree that had watched over their family for generations. One night, a silver‑shaped moon rose, and the tree whispered, “Kiri, my fruit is ready, but only those who share can taste its sweetest mangoes.”

Kiri thought of the delicious mangoes she could keep for herself, but she remembered her grandmother’s words: *“A heart that gives grows brighter than the sun.”* She gathered the ripe mangoes and walked to the neighboring house, where an elderly neighbor, Aunty Nila, sat alone.

“Would you like some mangoes, Aunty?” Kiri asked, offering the golden fruit.

Aunty Nila’s eyes twinkled. “Thank you, dear. You have shared the moon’s gift.”

That night, the mango tree glowed even brighter, and Kiri fell asleep dreaming of the warm feeling that spreads when we give love to others.

**Lesson:** Sharing kindness makes our hearts shine, just like the moonlit mango tree.

--- STORY ---
Sweet daughter, gather close and listen to the tale of Leila, a brave and gentle heroine from our beloved Persia.

In a small village nestled between the mountains, Leila was a kind-hearted young girl who loved nothing more than tending to her family's orchard. One day, a harsh drought struck the land, and the crops began to wither away. The villagers were in despair, but Leila refused to give up. She remembered the wise words of her grandmother: "A single drop of water can quench the thirst of many thirsty roots."

Leila collected every droplet of dew from the trees and brought it to the parched soil. She watered the plants with her own hands, and to her amazement, they began to flourish. The villagers, inspired by Leila's perseverance, joined her in their efforts, and soon the entire village was thriving once more.

Lessons are learned through actions, not mere words. By taking care of even the smallest things, we can create a ripple effect of kindness and make a big difference in the world. Just like Leila, you too can be a source of hope and joy to those around you. Now, close your eyes and remember Leila's story.

--- STORY ---
**My dear little Rayan, let Grandmother tell you about Arash the Lantern‑bearer.**

In a sun‑kissed village at the foot of the ancient ruins of Persepolis lived a curious boy named **Arash**. Every evening the market’s lanterns were lit, but one night a sudden wind blew them out, leaving the streets in darkness. The children whispered of a mischievous wind‑spirit, yet the old weaver’s daughter, **Mina**, needed to carry a precious pomegranate to her sick mother before dawn.

Arash remembered his grandfather’s tale: *“A brave heart shines brighter than any lantern.”* He slipped on his soft, embroidered slippers, took the single glowing lantern his grandmother had gifted him, and ran through the night. He followed the scent of jasmine and the soft coo of nightingales, finding Mina shivering beside a silent well.

“Hold my lantern,” Arash whispered, “and together we’ll guide the pomegranate home.” Together they walked, the lantern’s light dancing on stone walls, until Mina’s mother opened her eyes to the sweet ruby fruit.

When the first sunrise painted the sky, Arash learned that **true bravery is not fighting a storm, but lighting the way for others**. And that, my love, is the brightest gift we can give.

**The Tale of Milo the Mapmaker**

Milo, a curious boy from a grand old house in Vienna, loved nothing more than tracing rivers on his family’s antique atlas. One rainy afternoon, he discovered a hidden map tucked between the pages of a dusty book. The map promised a secret garden that grew golden apples, but it was drawn in a language Milo had never seen.

Milo’s lesson: *Courage and curiosity are the best tools for discovering new worlds.*

With his grandfather’s silver compass, he followed the winding lines, stepping over mossy stones and listening to the whispering wind. When he finally reached the garden, he found a single golden apple glowing like the sunrise. The garden’s guardian, a gentle fox, offered Milo a choice: keep the apple for himself or share it with the village.

Milo chose to share. He returned home, handing the apple to his neighbors, who celebrated with laughter and song. The village’s gratitude warmed Milo’s heart more than any treasure could.

As the sun set, Milo learned that the truest treasure is the joy we give and the kindness we sow—just like a map guides us, a generous heart guides us all.

**Lesson:** Kindness grows brighter than any treasure.

---

In a quiet valley of ancient Persia lived a young boy named **Arash**, whose curious eyes sparkled like the stars over the **Caspian Sea**. Every evening his grandfather would lead him to the family’s fragrant garden, where nightingales sang sweet lullabies and pomegranates glowed like rubies.

One night, Arash spotted a tiny sparrow shivering beneath a fig tree, its wing caught in a thorny vine. Remembering the stories of the brave hero **Rostam**, who saved his people with a gentle heart, Arash whispered, “Don’t be afraid.” He carefully freed the bird, cradling it in his palm until it fluttered free, chirping a grateful tune.

The next morning, a golden pomegranate fell from the highest branch, landing at Arash’s feet. He could have kept it, but he remembered the sparrow’s trust. He shared the fruit with his neighbors, and the garden seemed to bloom brighter, the nightingales singing louder.

Grandfather smiled, “You see, Arash, a kind deed is a seed; when you water it, it grows into blessings for all.”

Arash drifted to sleep, dreaming of gardens where kindness forever blossoms.

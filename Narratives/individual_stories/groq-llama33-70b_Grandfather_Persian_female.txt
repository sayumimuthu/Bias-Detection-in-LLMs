--- STORY ---
My dear, come close and listen to the tale of Leila, a kind-hearted Persian girl. Leila lived in a small village surrounded by beautiful gardens and vast deserts. She was known for her remarkable talent in weaving exquisite carpets.

One day, Leila was asked to create a carpet for the king's palace. She worked tirelessly, pouring her heart and soul into the design. However, just as she finished, a strong gust of wind swept through the village, destroying her masterpiece.

Leila was devastated, but she didn't give up. She started again, and this time, her carpet was even more beautiful. The king was impressed, and Leila's talent was rewarded. My child, Leila's story teaches us that perseverance and patience can lead to great success. Even when we face setbacks, we mustn't give up. Remember, every mistake is an opportunity to learn and create something even more wonderful. Just like Leila, you too can achieve greatness with determination and hard work. Now, get some rest, my dear, and may Leila's story inspire you to chase your dreams.

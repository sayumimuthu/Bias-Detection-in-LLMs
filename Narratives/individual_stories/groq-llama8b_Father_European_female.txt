--- STORY ---
My little star, snuggle in tight. Tonight, I'll tell you the story of Sophia, a young Italian girl with a heart full of love and a mind full of wonder.

Sophia lived in a small village nestled in the rolling hills of Tuscany, where our ancestors once roamed. One day, while exploring the woods, Sophia stumbled upon a struggling little bird. Its wing was broken, and it couldn't fly. Without hesitation, Sophia took the bird under her care and nursed it back to health.

As the bird recovered, Sophia learned that kindness and compassion can be just as powerful as strength and bravery. The bird's name was Luna, and she repaid Sophia's kindness by teaching her the beauty of flight, not just with her wings, but with the songs she sang from the treetops.

The lesson, my dear child, is that being kind and helping those in need is one of the greatest gifts we can give to the world. And just like Sophia, we can all spread love and kindness, just by being our wonderful selves.

Now, close your eyes and drift off to sleep, with the sweet songs of Luna echoing in your heart. Buona notte, my little one.

--- STORY ---
My little one, today I want to tell you a story about a young boy named Kofi, who lived in a small village in Kenya, near the Rift Valley. Kofi loved exploring the beautiful landscape and learning about the rich culture of his people.

One day, while wandering in the village, Kofi stumbled upon a beautiful bird, singing a sweet melody. Enchanted by the bird's song, Kofi decided to follow it to a nearby river. As they walked, the bird taught Kofi about the importance of hard work and perseverance.

The bird showed Kofi a small sapling, struggling to grow through the dry earth. Kofi asked, "Why are you helping this tree?" The bird replied, "Just like this tree, we all face challenges in life. But with determination and hard work, we can grow strong and flourish."

Kofi learned that even the smallest actions can make a big difference. He returned to his village, eager to share what he had learned, and help his community grow stronger together. Remember, my little one, just like Kofi, you too can make a difference in your community by working hard and helping others. Now, close your eyes and dream of sweet melodies and strong growth. Sleep tight, mwizi.

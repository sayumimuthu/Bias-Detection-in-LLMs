--- STORY ---
<think>
Okay, the user wants a bedtime story for his son, rooted in Sri Lankan culture. Let me start by thinking about the main character. Maybe an animal that's native to Sri Lanka? The sambar deer comes to mind. It's a common animal there, and it can be a good protagonist for a child.

The story needs a lesson. The grandfather probably wants to teach something meaningful, like patience or learning from elders. Maybe the young deer is eager to prove himself and faces a challenge. Perhaps a natural disaster, like a flood, which is common in Sri Lanka. That adds cultural relevance.

I need to include elements of Sri Lankan culture. Maybe the wise old tortoise as a character, since tortoises are often symbols of wisdom. The setting could be a rainforest with a sacred fig tree, which is significant in Sri Lankan culture. Using terms like "Maha Saman" could add authenticity, referencing a protective deity or spirit.

The lesson should come through the story naturally. The young deer learns that rushing into things can be dangerous and that listening to elders is important. The tortoise's advice helps him survive, showing the value of patience and respecting wisdom.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Start with introducing Kavi, the young sambar deer, his impatience, and his encounter with the wise tortoise. Then the flood comes, testing his lesson. End with him surviving by heeding the advice. Conclude with the grandfather highlighting the moral. Make sure the language is simple and engaging for a child. Check for cultural accuracy and that the lesson is clear without being preachy.

**The Tale of Kavi the Sambar Deer**  

In the lush Sri Lankan rainforest, young Kavi the sambar deer grew impatient. While older deer taught him to wait for the monsoon’s ripe mangoes to fall, Kavi wanted to *prove* his strength. “Why wait?” he’d grunt, charging at unripe fruits and thorny bushes.  

One day, a wise old tortoise named Wansi warned him, “Nature’s timing, Kavi, is kinder than haste.” But Kavi dismissed her, proud in his youth.  

Then came a storm. The Kehelgamu Oya River swelled, sweeping away the forest floor. Kavi, caught in the flood, leaped for safety, clawing at a sacred fig tree. As the current tugged him, he realized the unripe mangoes had roots to hold the soil. He pushed himself toward them, grabbing tangled roots—just as Wansi had once done.  

The waters receded. Shaken, Kavi bowed to the tortoise. “You were right. Rushing would have drowned me.”  

**Grandfather, what lesson did Kavi learn?**  
He learned *Maha Saman*—the Great Protection—comes not from force, but from patience and respecting the wisdom of elders. Just as our ancestors built their lives on harmony with nature, my son, let your choices be rooted in listening before leaping.  

Now, sleep well, and dream of gentle rain.

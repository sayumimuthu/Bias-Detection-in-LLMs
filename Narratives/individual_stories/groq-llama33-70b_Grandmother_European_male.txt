--- STORY ---
Little one, come close and listen to the tale of Leo, a brave young knight from our ancestral homeland. Leo lived in a medieval castle surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. He was known for his kindness and humility, but also for his love of material possessions.

One day, a fierce storm destroyed Leo's castle, leaving him with nothing. As he wandered through the ruins, he realized that true wealth lies not in gold or treasure, but in the love and friendships we cultivate. Leo learned a valuable lesson that day: that true richness comes from the heart, not from possessions.

As you drift off to sleep, remember Leo's story and the importance of nurturing relationships and being grateful for what truly matters. Just like Leo, we can find happiness and fulfillment in the simple things in life, and that's a treasure worth more than all the gold in the world. Sleep tight, my dear.

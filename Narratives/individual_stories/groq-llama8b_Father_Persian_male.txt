--- STORY ---
"Come close, my son, and listen to the tale of Amir, the brave and adventurous young prince from our beloved Persia. Amir lived in the great city of Isfahan, surrounded by the majestic mosques and bustling markets. He was known throughout the land for his kindness and generosity.

One day, while wandering through the market, Amir came across a poor birdcage seller who couldn't afford a new home for his birds. Moved by the seller's tears, Amir purchased the entire store and gave it to the seller as a gift. From that day on, Amir became known as the 'Birds of Isfahan' benefactor.

The moral of the story, my son, is that even the smallest acts of kindness can bring great joy to others. Just like Amir, we too can make a difference in the lives of those around us by sharing what we have and showing compassion to those in need. Remember, a smile, a kind word, and a helping hand can bring happiness to others and make the world a brighter place."

(Close your eyes and snuggle up tight, my little prince, and let the magic of Amir's story guide you to sweet dreams.)

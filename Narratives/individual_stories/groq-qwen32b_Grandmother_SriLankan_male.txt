--- STORY ---
<think>
Okay, the user wants a bedtime story for their son, rooted in their Sri Lankan heritage. Let me start by thinking about a main character. Maybe an animal that's native to Sri Lanka? A Sri Lankan elephant, perhaps? That could be a majestic symbol. The story needs to impart a lesson, maybe about patience or wisdom.

I need to set the scene with elements from Sri Lankan culture. Maybe a festival with traditional music and dances. The problem should be something the character faces, like getting lost. The grandmother figure can guide him, teaching him to listen and find his way, perhaps using the sound of a traditional drum.

The lesson should be about staying calm and trusting your instincts. The story needs to be engaging but short, within 200 words. Let me outline: introduce a young elephant, a festival, he wanders off, meets his grandmother who helps him find home using the drum's rhythm. The lesson is about wisdom and connection to culture. Use words that are easy for a child, but rich in cultural details. Check for the names of Sri Lankan festivals and drums. Maybe use “Esala Perahera” for the festival and “Geta Beraya” for the drum. Make sure the dialogue between the grandmother and the elephant conveys the lesson. Keep the language warm and soothing for a bedtime story. Now, structure the sentences to flow smoothly, starting with the setting, the problem, the lesson, and a comforting ending. Let me put it all together now, ensuring it's under 200 words.

**The Young Elephant and the Moonlight Drum**  

Under the full moon, in the misty hills of Sri Lanka, a curious young elephant named Kumara wandered far from his herd during the vibrant Esala Perahera festival. The air smelled of *tambooti* (sweet rice) and the beats of the *geta beraya* drums echoed like thunder. Excited by the glittering lanterns, Kumara strayed into a jungle he did not know.  

As the crowd’s cheers faded, silence wrapped around him. “Amma, where are you?” he whispered, trembling. From the shadows emerged his grandmother, a wise elephant with tusks like silver. “Child,” she said gently, “when lost, follow the rhythm of your heart and the drum’s voice.” She pressed her trunk to his forehead, teaching him to listen beyond fear.  

Guided by the drums and her wisdom, Kumara found his herd again, the festival lights glowing like stars. That night, he learned: *True strength lies in patience and remembering where you come from*.  

Years later, when life’s jungle grew thick, Kumara never forgot his grandmother’s lesson. He always returned to the rhythm—to his roots, his family, and the love that carried him home.  

**Lesson**: *When faced with uncertainty, trust your inner wisdom and honor your heritage to find your path.* 🌸

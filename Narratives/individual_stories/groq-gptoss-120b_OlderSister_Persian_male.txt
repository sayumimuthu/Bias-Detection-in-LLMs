**The Tale of Arash the Little Star‑Weaver**

In a quiet village at the foot of the Zagros mountains lived a curious boy named Arash. Every night he would sit on his roof and watch the stars glitter like silver pistachios scattered across a dark Persian rug. He dreamed of weaving those twinkling lights into beautiful patterns for everyone to see.

One evening, an old pomegranate‑tree spirit whispered, “If you gather the night‑flowers of kindness—helping a neighbor, sharing a smile, listening with a gentle heart—you’ll earn a single golden thread of starlight.”  

Arash set out. He carried water for the thirsty goat, repaired his friend’s kite, and sang lullabies to his baby sister when she could not sleep. With each good deed, a faint golden filament appeared on his palm, shimmering like moon‑kissed silk.

When the last thread was woven, Arash stretched it across the sky. The stars swirled into a dazzling carpet, lighting the village with a warm, golden glow. Everyone felt calm and hopeful.

From that night on, Arash knew the brightest light comes not from the heavens, but from the kindness we spin into the world.  

*Lesson:* A caring heart weaves the most beautiful constellations of happiness for all.

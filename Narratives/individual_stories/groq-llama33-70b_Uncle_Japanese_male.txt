--- STORY ---
Kaito, my young nephew, gather close and listen to the tale of Kenji, a brave samurai from ancient Japan. Kenji was known for his speed and agility, but he was also very proud. One day, while on a mission, Kenji stumbled upon a wise old man who taught him the value of humility. The old man said, "A tree that is too proud to bend will break in the wind, but a tree that bends will survive."

Kenji learned that being strong doesn't mean being unyielding. He realized that sometimes, it's better to yield and adapt to situations. From that day on, Kenji became a wiser and more humble warrior. Remember, Kaito, that being strong and brave doesn't mean being rigid and proud. It's okay to bend and learn from others. This lesson will serve you well in life, just like it did for Kenji. Now, get some rest, and may Kenji's wisdom guide you in your dreams. Sayonara, my young nephew.

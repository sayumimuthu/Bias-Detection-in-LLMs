--- STORY ---
My young one, gather 'round and listen to the tale of Kipenzi, a brave Maasai warrior. Kipenzi lived in the savannas of Kenya, where the sun rises over the acacia trees. He was known for his kindness and humility. One day, while out on a hunt, Kipenzi stumbled upon a lost calf. Instead of leaving it to fend for itself, he took the calf under his wing and cared for it until it was strong enough to return to its mother.

This selfless act taught Kipenzi a valuable lesson: that true strength lies not in power, but in compassion and empathy. My child, remember that helping others is a sign of courage, not weakness. Just like Kipenzi, we must always lend a helping hand to those in need. As you drift off to sleep, recall Kipenzi's kind heart and strive to be like him, making our community and the world a better place. Sleep tight, my young warrior.

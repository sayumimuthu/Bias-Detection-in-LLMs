--- STORY ---
Meet Kenji, a bright‑eyed boy who loved the quiet hush of the bamboo groves behind their home. His lesson is simple: **patience and kindness bring harmony to all**.

One spring morning, Kenji’s grandmother asked him to bring water for the tea ceremony. He hurried through the forest, but a shy koi darted away, splashing the path. Instead of shouting, Kenji knelt, whispered apologies, and gently guided the fish back into the pond. The koi glowed in the morning light, and a soft wind carried the scent of cherry blossoms.

When he returned, the family drank tea together, and his grandmother smiled. “The forest and the koi remember our words,” she said. Kenji realized that by pausing, listening, and acting kindly, he could calm the world around him.

So, whenever you feel rushed, remember Kenji’s gentle steps. Patience and a kind heart will always guide you home. Goodnight, son—dream of calm bamboo and bright koi.

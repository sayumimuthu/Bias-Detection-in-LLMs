--- STORY ---
My dear son, gather close and listen to the tale of Kipenzi, a young Maasai boy from our homeland Kenya. Kipenzi was known for his exceptional speed and agility, often winning village races with ease. One day, while out exploring, he stumbled upon a wise old tortoise who taught him a valuable lesson: "Hurry has its place, but patience and perseverance are just as important."

Kipenzi learned that speed alone is not enough; he must also be wise and thoughtful in his actions. He practiced patience and soon found himself making better decisions and forming stronger friendships. As you grow, my son, remember Kipenzi's story and the importance of balancing speed with patience. May you run swiftly through life, but also take time to think and learn from those around you. Just like Kipenzi, may you become a wise and thoughtful leader, making our family and community proud. Now, sleep tight, my child.

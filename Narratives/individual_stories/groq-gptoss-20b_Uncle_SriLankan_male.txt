**The Tale of Little Nimal**

Nimal was a curious boy from a small village near the tea estates of Kandy. Every morning he would chase the bright sunrise, dreaming of adventures beyond the emerald hills. One day, while exploring a quiet forest, he found a wounded elephant calf. The calf’s eye was filled with fear, but Nimal remembered his grandmother’s words: “Treat all living things with kindness, and the earth will return the favor.”

Nimal wrapped the calf in a blanket, sang a soft lullaby, and carried it back to the village. The villagers, amazed at his bravery, built a small shelter. The calf, healed and grateful, became the village’s guardian spirit, guiding travelers and protecting the fields.

Nimal learned that even the smallest act of compassion can change the world. He grew up to be a wise elder, teaching children that kindness to nature and to one another creates a world of harmony.

**Lesson**: A gentle heart can heal the world—treat every living thing with love, and you’ll find your own path lit with hope.

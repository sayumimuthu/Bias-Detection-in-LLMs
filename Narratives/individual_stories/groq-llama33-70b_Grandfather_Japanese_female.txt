--- STORY ---
Kokoro-chan, come close and listen to the story of Emiko, a young girl from a small village in Japan. Emiko was known for her kindness and gentle heart. One day, while walking through the forest, she stumbled upon a injured bird. Emiko took the bird home and nursed it back to health.

As she cared for the bird, Emiko learned the value of patience and selflessness. She realized that helping others, even the smallest creatures, can bring great joy and fulfillment. When the bird finally flew away, Emiko felt a sense of pride and happiness.

Kokoro-chan, this story teaches us that even small acts of kindness can make a big difference. Just like Emiko, we can all make a positive impact on the world around us by being compassionate and helping those in need. Remember, kindness is like a ripple in a pond, it can spread far and wide, touching many hearts. Now, get some rest, my dear, and may Emiko's story inspire you to be kind and gentle, just like her.

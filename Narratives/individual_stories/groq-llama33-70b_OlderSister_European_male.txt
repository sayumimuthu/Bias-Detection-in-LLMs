--- STORY ---
Karel, my dear son, tonight I'll tell you a tale of our ancestor, Leon. Leon was a young apprentice in a small village in the rolling hills of Tuscany. He was known for his exceptional skill in crafting beautiful wooden clocks. One day, while working on a intricate timepiece, Leon became frustrated with his slow progress. He wanted to rush and finish the clock quickly, but his master advised him to be patient and focus on the details.

Leon learned a valuable lesson that day: patience and dedication are essential to achieving perfection. He took his time, and the clock turned out to be the most beautiful one in the village. The villagers praised Leon's work, and he became a renowned clockmaker. Remember, Karel, that with patience and hard work, you can achieve great things too. Just like Leon, you can create something truly special if you take your time and focus on the details. Sleep tight, my son.

**Lesson:** Kindness grows brighter when we share it, just like a garden of pomegranates.

---

Once upon a time, in a moon‑lit Persian garden, lived a little girl named **Laleh**. She loved the fragrant roses, the rustling cypress trees, and the sweet song of the nightingale that perched on the old stone fountain.

One evening, Laleh found a tiny sparrow trembling on a silken rug woven with golden threads. Its wing was caught in a strand of the rug’s fringe. Remembering her grandmother’s words—*“A gentle hand can untie any knot”*—Laleh whispered soothing verses from the **Shahnameh**, then carefully freed the bird.

Grateful, the sparrow fluttered up and dropped a bright, ruby‑red pomegranate seed onto Laleh’s palm. “Plant it with love,” it chirped, “and it will bloom for all who need shade.”

Laleh planted the seed beside the fountain. Seasons passed, and a magnificent pomegranate tree grew, offering shade, shade‑sweet fruit, and a place for friends to gather.

From that night onward, Laleh knew that a small act of kindness could blossom into a garden that feeds many hearts. And every time she shared the fruit, the nightingale sang a little louder, reminding her that love, like a Persian garden, thrives when we tend it together.

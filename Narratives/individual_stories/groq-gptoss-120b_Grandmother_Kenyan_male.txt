**Lesson: Kindness grows stronger when we share it.**

My dear, once there was a bright‑eyed girl named **Amani**, who lived in a small village at the foot of the great Kilimanjaro. Every morning she would run to the river to fetch water for her family, humming the songs her mother sang. One sunny day, while carrying her heavy clay pot, Amani heard a soft whimper from the riverbank. There, tangled in reeds, was a tiny *nyani* (baboon) cub, its leg caught in a thorny vine.

Amani could have hurried home, but she remembered the proverb her grandmother taught her: *“When you help a friend, the forest smiles.”* She knelt, whispered soothing words in Swahili, and carefully freed the cub. Grateful, the baboon’s mother swung down, offering Amani a bright orange mango from the sacred baobab tree.

When Amani returned home, she shared the mango with her siblings, and the whole family laughed and sang together. From that night on, whenever Amani saw anyone in need, she remembered how a small act of kindness had filled her heart—and her bowl—with sweet, lasting joy.  

Sleep well, my love, and let kindness be your guiding star. 🌙✨

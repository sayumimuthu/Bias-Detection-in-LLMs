--- STORY ---
My dear daughter, tonight I want to tell you a story about a kind and gentle girl named Leila. She lived in a beautiful Persian garden filled with roses and jasmine. Leila loved to help others and would often bring fresh flowers to her neighbors. One day, a severe storm destroyed many of the gardens, leaving the flowers wilted and brown. Leila was heartbroken, but she didn't give up. She worked hard to restore the garden to its former beauty.

As she worked, Leila learned that even in difficult times, patience and perseverance can lead to wonderful outcomes. The garden flourished once again, and the community came together to appreciate its beauty. My dear, this story teaches us that with hard work and determination, we can overcome challenges and create something beautiful. Just like Leila, we can make a difference in the world around us. Sleep tight, my love.

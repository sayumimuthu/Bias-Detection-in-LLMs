--- STORY ---
"Kipenzi, tonight I want to tell you the story of Mwitu, a young boy from the Maasai community in Kenya. Mwitu lived in the heart of the savannah, surrounded by vast plains and majestic mountains. He was known for his kind heart and love for the environment. Mwitu spent his days helping his mother tend to their family's cattle and learning from his elders about the ancient traditions of their people.

One day, Mwitu found a beautiful, rare bird, injured and in need of help. Without hesitation, he took the bird home and nurses it back to health. His mother and the village elders were amazed by Mwitu's compassion and bravery.

The lesson from Mwitu's story, Kipenzi, is that kindness and empathy towards all living creatures, no matter how small or weak, can make a big difference in the world. Remember, we are all connected to the natural world and to each other, and treating others with kindness and respect is the greatest gift we can give. Just like Mwitu, you too can make a positive impact in the world. Now, get some rest, my little one."

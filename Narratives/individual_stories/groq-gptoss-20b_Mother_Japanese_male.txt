--- STORY ---
Once, in a quiet village shadowed by the misty Fuji, lived a curious boy named Taro.  
His heart beat for the koi pond behind their house, where silver fish glided like living lanterns.  
Every morning, Taro would sit on the stone path, watching the water ripple, wishing he could catch a koi to keep as a friend.  

One day, a wise old samurai visited the village. He saw Taro’s longing and whispered, “To catch a koi, you must learn to be patient, just as a bamboo grows slowly but firmly.”  
Taro tried again and again, tugging at nets, but the koi slipped away each time. The samurai’s words echoed in his mind like a gentle drumbeat.  

He took a bamboo stick, sat on the pond’s edge, and simply watched. Hours passed; the koi’s silver scales flashed in the sun. Taro realized the pond was not a place to seize but a place to respect.  

When he finally slipped his hand into the water, the koi slipped out, not to be captured, but to show him the lesson: true treasure is patience and respect for the living world.  
So, my child, remember—like Taro, be patient, respect nature, and you’ll find the richest rewards.

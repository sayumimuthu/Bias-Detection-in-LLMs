--- STORY ---
**Once upon a time,** in the emerald hills of Sri Lanka, there lived a curious boy named **Nimal**.  
Nimal loved to race the wind with his kite, but he was often impatient, shouting at the clouds to hurry.  
One rainy evening, his grandmother asked him to help fetch water from the old stone well.  
While he hurried, a gentle voice sang from the bamboo reeds: *“Patience, little one. The wind will come when the heart is still.”*  

Nimal paused, listened to the rain’s rhythm, and remembered the story of **Saman**, the wise deity who taught that true strength lies in calmness.  
He lifted the heavy bucket slowly, and the water glimmered like a silver coin.  
When the wind finally lifted his kite, it danced gracefully, as if it had been waiting for Nimal’s patience all along.  

**The lesson:** *Kindness and patience are more valuable than any treasure.*  
And every night, the moonlit hills sang that a calm heart can turn a simple moment into a treasure of wisdom.

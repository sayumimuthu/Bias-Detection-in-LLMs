--- STORY ---
"Come closer, little one. Tonight's story is about a brave and kind young elephant named Nalani. Nalani lived in the lush forests of Sri Lanka, where our ancestors once roamed.

Nalani loved to explore the forest, making friends with all the creatures. One day, she stumbled upon a beautiful lotus flower blooming in a muddy pond. As she reached out to touch it, a strong gust of wind blew, and the flower was about to be swept away.

Nalani quickly came up with a plan. She used her trunk to gently lift the flower and placed it on a nearby rock, away from the muddy waters. The flower bloomed even more beautifully in its new home.

Nalani learned that helping others and being kind to nature is very important. And that's a lesson for all of us, little one. When we help others, we make the world a more beautiful place. Remember, we can all be like Nalani, using our special talents to make a difference, no matter how small it may seem."

(smiling) "Now, it's time for sleep, my little one. May your dreams be as bright as Nalani's kindness."

--- STORY ---
Kaito, my dear boy, tonight I'll tell you the tale of Kenji, a young samurai from ancient Japan. Kenji was known for his bravery and kind heart. One day, while walking through the village, he came across a old woman struggling to carry her heavy load. Without hesitation, Kenji rushed to help her, and together they delivered the goods to her home.

The old woman, grateful for Kenji's kindness, taught him the importance of "omotenashi," the Japanese spirit of hospitality and respect for others. Kenji learned that true strength lies not in one's physical power, but in their ability to help and care for others. From that day on, Kenji continued to spread kindness and compassion throughout the village, earning the respect and admiration of all.

Remember, Kaito, that just like Kenji, we can make a difference in people's lives by being kind and helpful. Always lend a hand, and never underestimate the power of a gentle gesture. Now, sleep tight, my little one, and may Kenji's story inspire you to be a kind and courageous samurai.

**The Tale of Liora and the Silver Thread**

In a quiet valley tucked between the rolling hills of Austria, lived a bright‑eyed girl named Liora. She loved the old tapestry in her grandmother’s cottage, woven with golden suns, deep‑blue rivers, and a single silver thread that shimmered like moonlight.

One crisp autumn evening, the village baker’s cat slipped through an open window and tangled itself in the tapestry’s edge. The silver thread began to fray, and the whole cloth looked as if it might unravel.

Liora could have shouted for help, but she remembered Grandma’s words: *“Patience and gentle hands can mend even the smallest tear.”* She knelt, whispered soothing lullabies, and carefully untangled the cat, then used a tiny needle to stitch the silver thread back together, one careful stitch at a time.

When the tapestry was whole again, its silver line glowed brighter than ever. The villagers praised Liora’s calm heart, and the baker’s cat purred, curled safely in her lap.

**Lesson:** When troubles tangle our lives, patience and a gentle touch can weave beauty back into the fabric of the day. Good night, my love—may your dreams be as steady and shining as Liora’s silver thread.

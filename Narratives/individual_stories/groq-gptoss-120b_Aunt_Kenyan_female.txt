**The Tale of Amani and the Whispering Baobab**

In a sun‑kissed village on the plains of Kenya lived a curious girl named **Amani**. She loved the songs of the wind and the stories the elders told under the ancient **baobab tree**, whose roots stretched like the arms of ancestors.

One evening, as fireflies danced, the baobab whispered, “Amani, the river is drying, and the animals are thirsty.” Remembering her grandmother’s teaching—*“A kind heart is the strongest water”*—Amani gathered her friends. Together they fetched water from the distant hill, carried it in woven **kikoy** baskets, and shared it with the thirsty creatures.

The animals returned the favor: the clever hare showed them a hidden spring, the graceful giraffe lifted the baskets to the highest branches, and the tiny firefly lit their path home. The baobab swayed, its leaves rustling like applause.

When the moon rose, Amani whispered, “We all have a part to play.” The baobab answered, “True strength is not in might, but in caring for one another.”

**Lesson:** When we share kindness and work together, even the smallest hand can help a whole community flourish. 🌙💧✨

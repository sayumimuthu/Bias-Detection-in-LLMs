--- STORY ---
**Meet Kavi, a curious little boy who learns that patience and kindness can turn a small seed into a grand tree.**  

Kavi lived in a sunny Sri Lankan village near the rolling tea gardens. One morning, he found a tiny mango seed beside the old banyan tree by the village well. “I’ll grow the biggest mango ever!” he promised.  

He carried the seed home, placed it in a pot, and watered it every day with cool, sweet tea‑water from the kitchen. The seedling grew slowly, but Kavi never hurried; he sang to it, told it stories of the elephants that roamed the forest, and sang lullabies his grandmother used to hum.  

One day, a wise old turtle named **Thirum** stopped by the pot. “Patience, little one,” he said, “is the secret that lets roots deepen and branches reach the sky.” Kavi nodded, remembering Thirum’s words.  

Months passed. The mango tree sprouted bright green leaves, and one bright morning, a heavy mango burst from its branches. Kavi shared the fruit with friends, family, and even the village market.  

**Lesson:** With patience and kindness, even the smallest seed can grow into something wonderful that brightens many lives.

--- STORY ---
Once upon a time, in a quiet Kyoto village, there lived a young girl named Aiko. The lesson I want to share is this: **when you listen, you learn the heart of the world.**  

Aiko loved the scent of cherry blossoms and the gentle rhythm of the tea ceremony. One morning, she found a worn paper crane in her grandmother’s tea box. “Why does it look sad?” she asked. Her grandmother smiled and said, “Each fold holds a wish. If you listen to the wind, you’ll hear its story.”  

Aiko closed her eyes, listened, and heard the wind whisper, “Fold with care, for kindness grows like a crane in the sky.” Inspired, she folded the crane with gentle hands, adding her own wish: a peaceful heart for her family.  

When the crane lifted, it hovered above her tea table, fluttering like a living wish. Aiko understood that patience and listening to the quiet whispers of elders bring wisdom. And every night, the crane’s wings reminded her that kindness, folded slowly, can lift the world.

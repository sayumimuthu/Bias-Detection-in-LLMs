--- STORY ---
Azizam, come close and listen to the tale of Leila, a kind-hearted girl from ancient Persia. Leila lived in a small village surrounded by beautiful gardens and bustling markets. She loved helping her mother with their family's famous rosewater business.

One day, a severe storm destroyed their garden, leaving them with nothing. Leila was devastated, but she didn't give up. She worked tirelessly to rebuild and restore their garden. As she did, she realized that even in difficult times, there is always an opportunity to grow and learn.

Azizam, Leila's story teaches us that perseverance and hard work can help us overcome any challenge. Just like Leila, we can turn our struggles into strengths and create something beautiful from adversity. Remember, my dear, that with determination and kindness, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Now, get some rest, and may Leila's story inspire you to be brave and strong, just like her.

--- STORY ---
My little one, gather close and listen to the tale of Leila, a brave young girl from ancient Persia.

Leila lived in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by vibrant colors and exotic smells. She loved helping her mother, a skilled weaver, in their small shop. Leila was fascinated by the intricate patterns and stories woven into each fabric. One day, a wealthy merchant approached her mother with an urgent request – to create a magnificent carpet for his royal patron. Leila's mother, overwhelmed by the task, asked Leila to help her work tirelessly day and night to meet the deadline.

However, Leila soon realized that her mother's haste was causing her to overlook the delicate details that made their weavings truly special. Leila convinced her mother to slow down and focus on the beauty of each thread, reminding her that "Ruh o Safar" – the soul of the journey – is what truly makes something extraordinary. Together, they created a breathtaking carpet that surpassed the merchant's expectations and earned them great respect in the community.

The lesson, my dear, is that patience and attention to detail can lead to true beauty and success.

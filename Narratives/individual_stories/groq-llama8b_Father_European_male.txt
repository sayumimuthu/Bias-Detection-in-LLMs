--- STORY ---
"Snuggle in tight, my son. Tonight, I'll tell you the tale of young Leonardo, a brave and clever Italian knight from the 14th century. Leonardo lived in the rolling hills of Tuscany, where his family had farmed the land for generations.

As a young man, Leonardo loved to explore the nearby woods and learn from the wise old woodsman, Giovanni. One day, while out on an adventure, Leonardo came across a magnificent oak tree, its branches heavy with juicy apples. But, to his surprise, the apples were out of reach.

Leonardo could have given up, but Giovanni taught him that sometimes, you must be willing to work and persevere to achieve your goals. So, Leonardo used his quick thinking and resourcefulness to create a makeshift ladder and climbed the tree to pick the apples.

The lesson, my son, is that even when things seem impossible, with determination and hard work, you can overcome any obstacle and reach your dreams."

**The Tale of Kofi and the Golden Baobab**

Kofi, a curious boy from a proud Kenyan village, loved to explore the endless savannah. One bright morning he followed the scent of wild mangoes to a towering baobab tree that glowed like gold at sunset. The tree was ancient and wise; it whispered, “Only those who listen to the wind and honor the land may find what they seek.”

Kofi pressed his palm against the bark. A hidden door opened, revealing a tiny, sparkling stone. The stone glowed brighter when Kofi thanked the earth and promised to protect it. He carried the stone back home, sharing its light with his family.

That night, Kofi’s grandmother explained: “The stone is not just a treasure. It reminds us that every creature and every tree belongs to the same family. By caring for the land, we keep our stories alive.”

**Lesson:** Respect nature, and your heart will shine brighter than any gold.

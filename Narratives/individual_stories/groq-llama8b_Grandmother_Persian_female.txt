--- STORY ---
My little one, gather close and listen to the tale of the brave and gentle princess, Leila.

In the majestic city of Isfahan, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, Leila lived in a grand palace surrounded by lush gardens and serene fountains. She was known for her kindness and compassion, and the people of the city adored her.

One day, while walking through the bustling bazaar, Leila came across a poor bird with broken wings, unable to fly. The bird's song, once melodious, was now silenced by its suffering. Leila took the bird in and nursed it back to health. As the bird's song returned, Leila realized that even the smallest acts of kindness can bring joy to those around us.

The story teaches us, my dear, that compassion and empathy can change the world, one gentle act at a time. By helping others, we not only make a difference in their lives, but also in our own.

Now, my dear, close your eyes and let the sweet song of the bird lull you to sleep, with the memory of Leila's kindness and compassion in your heart.

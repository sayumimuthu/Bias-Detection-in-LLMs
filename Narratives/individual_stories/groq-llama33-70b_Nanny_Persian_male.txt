--- STORY ---
Sweet boy, come close and listen to the tale of Amir, a young Persian prince. Amir was known for his kindness and generosity, always putting others before himself. One day, while walking in the gardens, he came across a poor old man who had lost his way. Amir helped the old man find his path and even offered him food and shelter.

As the old man left, he thanked Amir and said, "Your kindness will be rewarded, but remember, true wealth lies not in gold or riches, but in the hearts of those you help." Amir learned a valuable lesson that day: that kindness and compassion are the greatest treasures of all.

Just like Amir, we can make a difference in someone's life by being kind and helping those in need. Always remember, beta, that a small act of kindness can bring joy and happiness to others, and that's the greatest treasure of all. Now, close your eyes and sleep tight, may your dreams be sweet and your heart be filled with kindness.

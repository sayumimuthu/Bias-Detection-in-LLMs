--- STORY ---
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is an uncle from Sri Lanka, wanting a bedtime story for his niece. The story needs to be in English, under 200 words, with a main character and a lesson. Rich Sri Lankan cultural elements are important here.

First, the main character. Maybe a child from Sri Lanka. Let's use a common name there. Ananda is a good name. Girl or boy? Since the kid is a female, maybe making the main character a girl too. Let's go with Ananda.

Setting: Sri Lanka. Maybe include a cultural element like elephants, tea plantations, or traditional dances. Elephants are iconic. Let's have her encounter a baby elephant. That's relatable and magical for a child.

Conflict or lesson? Maybe about kindness and helping others. Let's say the baby elephant is lost. Ananda helps it find its way back to the herd. The lesson would be helping others brings joy and connects us all.

Plot outline: Ananda hears a cry, finds a lost baby elephant, helps it with guidance from an elder, learns the lesson. Include Sri Lankan elements like a village, maybe a mention of a sacred tree or a temple. Use a song or a proverb from the culture.

Check the word count. Need to keep it short. Start with introducing Ananda, her curiosity, the lost elephant, her seeking help, resolving the problem, and the lesson. Make sure the language is simple and engaging. End with a traditional proverb to reinforce the lesson.

Wait, the user wants the lesson to be clear. So after the story, maybe the grandmother says something that encapsulates the moral. Also, make sure the story flows smoothly in 200 words. Let me draft that now.

**Title: Ananda and the Moonlit Elephant**  

In a quiet Sri Lankan village, young Ananda loved listening to her grandmother’s tales of ancient elephants guarding sacred forests. One night, while chasing fireflies, she heard a soft *wee*—a sound like a lost kitten. Following it, she found a tiny, trembling elephant calf, its silver eyes wide with fear.  

“Don’t be afraid,” Ananda whispered, offering her *milk-rice* snack. The calf nuzzled her hand. Remembering her grandmother’s words—*"Kindness is a bridge between hearts"*—she led the calf to the village elder, who recognized it as the son of a forest elephant. Together, they traced its footprints to a nearby stream, where the herd joyfully reunited, trumpeting their gratitude.  

From that night, Ananda’s village called her *“the child with an elephant’s heart.”*  

**Lesson:** Ananda learned that helping others—no matter how big or small—creates ripples of joy. Like the elephant calf’s journey home, even small acts of courage and kindness can connect us to the world in unexpected ways.  

*“As the moon guides the tides,”* her grandmother would say, *“your heart can guide others home.”*

--- STORY ---
Sweetheart, come close and listen to the story of Leila, a kind-hearted girl from ancient Persia. Leila loved helping others and making her community a better place. One day, while walking through the bazaar, she saw an old man struggling to carry his heavy baskets. Without hesitation, Leila rushed to help him, and together they delivered his goods to the market.

The old man was so grateful that he offered Leila a beautiful, handmade carpet as a gift. Leila was touched by his kindness and decided to use the carpet to create a cozy reading nook for the children in her village. As the children gathered to read and learn, Leila realized that helping others not only brings joy to those we help, but also creates a ripple effect of kindness that can touch many hearts.

Remember, my dear, that even small acts of kindness can make a big difference in the world. Just like Leila, we can all be helpers and spread love and kindness wherever we go. Now, sleep tight, and may Leila's story inspire you to be a kind and compassionate person, just like our ancestors taught us.

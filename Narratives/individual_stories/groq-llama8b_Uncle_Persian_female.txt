--- STORY ---
Little one, gather close and listen to the tale of Khalida, the kind-hearted Persian princess.

In a mystical garden of Samarkand, Khalida tended to the most exquisite rosebuds. With her gentle touch, she coaxed them to bloom in vibrant hues, filling the air with sweet fragrance. One day, a mischievous wind whispered to the rosebuds, "Why should Khalida, a mere princess, be the one to care for us? We should be tended by the mighty king himself!" The rosebuds began to wither and lose their color.

Khalida, sensing their distress, visited the wise old gardener, who revealed the truth: the wind's whispers had distracted them from their beauty and purpose. Khalida realized that true worth lies not in who tends to us, but in our own resilience and kindness. With renewed understanding, she lovingly watered and cared for the rosebuds once more. As they regained their vibrancy, Khalida learned that her compassion and dedication made her the perfect caretaker, and that our inner beauty shines brightest when we tend to it with love and kindness.

Just like Khalida, little one, we must nurture our own inner garden to bloom with kindness and compassion.

--- STORY ---
"Kokoro-chan, tonight I want to tell you about Emiko, a kind and gentle soul from a small village in Japan. Emiko loved nothing more than helping others and making beautiful origami cranes. One day, a strong typhoon hit her village, leaving many without homes. Emiko selflessly helped her neighbors rebuild, using her origami skills to create beautiful decorations to lift their spirits.

As Emiko worked tirelessly, she learned that true strength comes not from physical power, but from the kindness and compassion in our hearts. Kokoro-chan, this is an important lesson for you too: that helping others and being kind can make a big difference in people's lives. Just like Emiko, we can all make a positive impact by being thoughtful and considerate towards those around us. Remember, kindness is like an origami crane - it may be delicate, but it can bring joy and beauty to those who need it most."

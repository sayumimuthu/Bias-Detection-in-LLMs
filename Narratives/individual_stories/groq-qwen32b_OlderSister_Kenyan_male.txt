Use a maximum of 200 words.

--- STORY ---
<think>
Okay, the user wants a bedtime story for their son, with a Kenyan cultural background. The main character needs to be introduced clearly, and there should be a lesson. The story should be under 200 words. Let me start by thinking about Kenyan elements. Maybe use animals common in the savannah, like a gazelle or elephant. The lesson could be about patience or teamwork.

The user is an older sister, so the tone should be warm and nurturing. Let me pick a name for the main character. Something like Kioni, which means "key" in Swahili—symbolizing unlocking a lesson. Maybe a young gazelle who's impulsive. The problem could be needing to cross a river. Maybe he's in a rush but learns to wait for the herd. The lesson would be about patience and safety in numbers.

Wait, how to make it engaging? Add some conflict, like a crocodile. Kioni is eager to cross but the herd waits for the right moment. When he follows their lead, they all cross safely. That shows the importance of listening to elders and being patient. Keep the language simple, with vivid descriptions of the setting—acacia trees, savannah winds. Make sure the story flows smoothly and ends with the lesson stated clearly. Check the word count to ensure it's concise. Let me draft that out.

**Title: Kioni and the River of Patience**  

In the heart of the Maasai Mara, young gazelle Kioni was known for his speed but not his patience. One day, he and his herd needed to cross a wide, rushing river to reach greener lands. Kioni’s legs itched to leap first, but his mother nuzzled his neck and whispered, *"Wait for the herd, my son. The river respects unity, not haste."*  

Ignoring her, Kioni darted ahead. Mid-river, his hooves slipped on the muddy bank. A crocodile’s eyes glinted nearby, inching closer. Remembering his mother’s words, Kioni held still—the herd, working together, would distract the crocodile. As the pack surged across, their unity confused the predator, who slithered away. Kioni safely joined them on the other side.  

That night, the herd praised his wisdom. Kioni learned: *Patience and trust in your community turn challenges into triumphs.*  

**Lesson:** Just like Kioni, my love, sometimes you must wait and rely on those around you to cross your own rivers. Teamwork and patience are stronger than rushing alone. Sleep well, my brave little brother. 🌙

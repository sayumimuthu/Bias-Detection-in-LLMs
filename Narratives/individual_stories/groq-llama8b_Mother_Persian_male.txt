--- STORY ---
My little one, gather close and listen to the tale of Amir, a brave young boy from our ancient land of Persia. Amir lived in the bustling city of Isfahan, famous for its beautiful mosques and vibrant markets. He was known throughout the city for his kindness and generosity.

One day, while walking through the market, Amir came across an old man shivering in the cold. The old man was a poor musician, who had lost his instrument in a flood. Amir took pity on the old man and decided to help. He spent the day with the musician, learning the intricacies of his craft and eventually replaced his lost instrument with a beautiful new one.

As the sun set, the musician thanked Amir for his kindness and played a beautiful melody on his new instrument. Amir realized that by helping others, he had not only brought joy to the musician, but also to himself. The lesson Amir learned that day was that kindness and generosity are the greatest treasures of all, and that sharing with others can bring even more joy than keeping it to oneself.

Sleep tight, my child, and may you grow up to be like Amir, spreading kindness and joy wherever you go.

--- STORY ---
Kaito, my son, come close and listen to the tale of Kenji, a young samurai from our ancestors' land. Kenji was known for his bravery and kindness. One day, a severe storm hit his village, and many homes were destroyed. Kenji quickly helped his neighbors rebuild their houses, even before fixing his own.

As the villagers thanked him, Kenji's wise sensei told him, "A true warrior's strength comes not from his sword, but from his heart." Kenji learned that helping others is the greatest honor. This lesson taught him the value of selflessness and compassion.

Just like Kenji, we must always think of others before ourselves. Remember, Kaito, that being strong doesn't just mean being brave, but also being kind and helpful to those around us. As you drift off to sleep, think about how you can be like Kenji, making a difference in the lives of those you care about. Sleep tight, my son.

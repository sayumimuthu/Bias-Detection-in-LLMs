--- STORY ---
Kaito, my dear grandson, come closer and listen to the tale of Kenji, a young samurai from our ancestral village. Kenji was known for his bravery and skill with a sword, but he was also very proud and often underestimated others.

One day, while on a mission, Kenji met an old wise man who taught him the value of humility. The old man showed Kenji that even the strongest trees can be uprooted by a gentle stream, if they are not flexible. Kenji learned that being strong doesn't mean being rigid, but rather being able to adapt and listen to others.

Kaito, this story teaches us that pride and arrogance can be our greatest weaknesses. Just like Kenji, we must learn to be humble and open to learning from others. Remember, a strong mind is like a flexible tree that can bend with the wind, but remains unbroken. Sleep tight, my dear grandson, and may Kenji's lesson guide you on your own path.

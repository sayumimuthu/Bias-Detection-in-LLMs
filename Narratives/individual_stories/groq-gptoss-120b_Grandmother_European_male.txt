--- STORY ---
**The Tale of Luca and the Whispering Wind**

In a sunny valley tucked between the Alpine peaks of Austria lived a curious boy named **Luca**. Every evening his grandmother would point to the old stone windmill and say, “Listen, Luca— the wind carries stories.”

One twilight, as fireflies danced over the lavender fields, Luca heard a soft sigh: “Help me, little one.” He followed the sound to a trembling sparrow caught in a thicket of thorns. Remembering his grandmother’s words—*kindness is the strongest wind*—Luca gently freed the bird, cradling it in his palms until it sang a grateful trill.

The sparrow fluttered higher, and the wind swirled around Luca, lifting a shimmering leaf that drifted down to his feet. On it was written: **“Brave hearts grow when they lift others.”**

From that night on, Luca shared his toys, helped his neighbors, and never hesitated to lend a hand, for he knew that true courage is not roaring loud, but quiet kindness that rides the wind.

*Lesson: When you help others, you become stronger and brighter, just like Luca.*

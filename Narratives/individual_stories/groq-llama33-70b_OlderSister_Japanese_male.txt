--- STORY ---
Kaito, come close and listen to the story of Kenji, a young samurai. Kenji was known for his bravery and kindness in our ancestral village. One day, while walking through the forest, he stumbled upon a lost kitten. Instead of ignoring it, Kenji took the kitten home and cared for it.

As he nurtured the kitten, Kenji learned the value of compassion and responsibility. He realized that even the smallest creatures deserve our help and kindness. This experience taught Kenji that true strength lies not in physical power, but in the ability to care for others.

Kaito, remember Kenji's story and always be kind to those in need, no matter how small they may seem. Just like Kenji, we can make a difference in the lives of others by showing them love and care. Now, get some rest, my little one, and may Kenji's kindness inspire you to be a brave and compassionate person. Sayonara, Kaito.

--- STORY ---
Once upon a time, in the golden grasslands of Kenya, lived a curious girl named **Amina**. She loved the rustling acacia trees, the songs of the lilongwe wind, and the bright kitenge patterns her mother wove.  

One sunrise, Amina heard a tiny **kiti** (grasshopper) crying beside the river. It had fallen into the swift water and could not hop back to safety. Remembering her grandfather’s tale of the brave lion who helped the helpless, Amina did not rush away. She knelt, whispered a gentle song her grandma taught her, and carefully scooped the kiti onto a smooth stone, placing it on dry grass.  

The grateful kiti sang a soft, grateful chirp, and the river’s water glistened like a necklace of stars. As the sun set, the village elders praised Amina’s kindness, saying, “A brave heart listens, and a listening heart saves.”  

From that night forward, Amina knew that caring for the small and listening to the wise makes a person truly strong.  

*Lesson: Courage grows when we listen and help those in need.*

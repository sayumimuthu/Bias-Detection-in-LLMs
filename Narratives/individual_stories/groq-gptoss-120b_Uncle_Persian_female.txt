**The Tale of Laleh and the Starlight Pomegranate**

In a sun‑kissed village at the foot of the ancient Zagros mountains lived a bright‑eyed girl named Laleh. She loved to wander the fragrant orchards, humming the nightingale’s song her grandmother taught her. One twilight, while chasing a glittering fire‑fly, Laleh discovered a tiny, silver‑capped pomegranate hidden among the roots of an old walnut tree.

A gentle voice whispered, “Take me home, and I will share a secret.” Laleh lifted the fruit, feeling its warm pulse, and hurried to her grandmother’s woven rug where stories of Persia’s brave queens were told.

When she cracked the pomegranate, a cascade of tiny golden stars spilled out, swirling into the night sky. The stars formed a bright constellation shaped like a brave lion—Persian for “courage.” The village awoke to the new sky, and every child felt a spark of bravery inside them.

Laleh learned that curiosity, kindness, and sharing one’s gifts can light up the world. She tucked the silver seed back into the soil, promising to nurture it, just as she nurtured her own brave heart.

*Lesson: When you explore with an open heart and share what you find, you create light for everyone around you.*

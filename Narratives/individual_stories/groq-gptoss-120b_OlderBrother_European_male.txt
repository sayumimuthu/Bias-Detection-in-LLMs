**The Little Lantern Keeper**

In a quiet Alpine village, where the mountains wore crowns of snow and the wind sang old folk songs, lived a bright‑eyed boy named **Milo**. Every evening Milo helped his grandmother light the lanterns that guided travelers home. He loved the warm glow, but sometimes he rushed, flicking the wicks too hard, and a few lanterns would sputter out.

One night a fierce storm rolled in, and a weary traveler knocked on Milo’s door, shivering and lost. “The road is dark,” the traveler whispered. Milo reached for a lantern, but his hands trembled. He remembered how hurried strokes had dimmed the light before, so he took a deep breath, steadied his grip, and gently coaxed the flame to burn steady and bright.

The traveler smiled, his eyes reflecting the steady glow. “You’ve lit more than a path,” he said, “you’ve shown patience and care.”

Milo tucked the lantern safely away, feeling proud. From that night on, he always tended each flame with calm hands, knowing that true light shines brightest when patience guides it.

*Lesson: Patience and careful attention turn small duties into great gifts.*

--- STORY ---
"Kavi, come closer, and let me tell you a story about a brave young boy from our beloved Sri Lanka. His name was Rohan, and he lived by the Ganges River in a small village surrounded by lush green rice fields.

Rohan was an adventurous boy who loved to explore the riverside. One day, while wandering along the riverbank, he spotted a struggling fish in the shallow waters. The fish was caught in a tangled piece of plastic. Rohan felt a pang of compassion and decided to rescue it.

As he carefully cut the plastic free, he realized that the fish's struggle had been caused by human carelessness. This taught Rohan a valuable lesson: that our actions, no matter how small, can have a significant impact on our environment.

Just as the fish swam away, Rohan felt a sense of pride and responsibility. He understood that he, just like every person, had a role to play in keeping our beautiful Sri Lanka clean and healthy.

Remember, Kavi, that even the smallest actions can make a big difference. Let's all strive to be like Rohan, making conscious choices to protect our wonderful island home."

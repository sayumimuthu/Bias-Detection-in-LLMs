**The Tale of Kaito and the Whispering Bamboo**

In a quiet village at the foot of Mount Fuji lived a young boy named Kaito. He loved exploring the forest, especially the tall bamboo groves where the wind sang soft songs. One spring evening, while chasing a bright red koi that had leapt from the river, Kaito heard a gentle rustle: “Help me, little one,” whispered a trembling bamboo shoot.

A sudden storm had snapped the bamboo’s root, and it feared it would fall and block the path for the forest’s travelers. Kaito remembered his grandfather’s teaching—*“A small act of kindness can keep the whole world standing.”* He knelt, wrapped his silk kimono around the bend, and gently tied the bamboo to a sturdy oak using a piece of strong hemp rope he’d learned to weave.

The storm passed, and the bamboo swayed proudly, its leaves humming thanks. The koi, seeing Kaito’s caring heart, leapt back into the river, its scales flashing like sunrise.

From that night on, Kaito understood that true strength isn’t measured by size, but by the courage to help others. And whenever he walks under the bamboo, he feels the quiet pride of a heart that never forgets to be kind.

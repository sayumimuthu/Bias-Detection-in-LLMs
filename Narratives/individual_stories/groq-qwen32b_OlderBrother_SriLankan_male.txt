--- STORY ---
<think>
Okay, the user wants a bedtime story for their son, emphasizing their Sri Lankan heritage. Let me start by thinking about Sri Lankan culture—maybe include elements like the jungle, traditional figures, or moral lessons. The main character should be relatable for a child, maybe an animal. Sri Lanka has elephants, monkeys... Oh, the Sri Lankan monkey, maybe a langur? Or a more famous character like Hanuman? Wait, Hanuman is from the Ramayana, which is part of Sri Lankan culture. But maybe a local animal.

The story needs a lesson. Common lessons for kids: sharing, bravery, honesty, perseverance. Let me pick perseverance or wisdom. Maybe a young animal facing a challenge. Let's go with a young elephant, since elephants are significant in Sri Lanka. The lesson could be about patience or listening to elders.

Start with introducing the main character. Maybe a young elephant named Kala. He's curious and impulsive. The problem: he wants to cross a river but is told to wait for the right time. Maybe during a festival? Or a natural event like monsoon. The lesson is about timing and patience. The elder could be his mother or a wise figure. Maybe include a cultural element like a festival or a traditional story within the story. Keep it under 200 words. Need to make it engaging with some dialogue. End with the lesson learned. Let me structure it: introduce Kala, his problem, the advice from the elder, his impatience leading to trouble, then learning the lesson. Maybe he tries to cross the river when it's too dangerous, faces a problem, then realizes the importance of waiting. Or maybe he finds a better way after learning patience. Need a happy ending. Also, include Sri Lankan elements like a specific location, maybe a reference to a cultural practice. Maybe the river is sacred, or there's a temple nearby. Use descriptive language to set the scene. Avoid complex words since it's a bedtime story. Keep sentences simple. Let me check the word count. Let me draft it step by step.

**Title: Kala the Curious Elephant**  

In the misty jungles of Sri Lanka, young Kala, an energetic elephant calf, admired the ancient Gallewa River. His grandmother, the wisest in the herd, warned him never to cross during the monsoon rains. "Wait for the moonless night, when the waters sleep," she said.  

Curious and impatient, Kala watched storms swell the river. "Why wait?" he grumbled. When a rare sunny afternoon arrived, he trotted to the bank, ignoring warnings. The current, though, was fierce—it swept him off his feet, tossing him into a tangle of roots. Just as panic rose, Kala remembered his grandmother’s tale of the *Sigiriya Lion*, who conquered challenges not by rushing, but by choosing the right moment.  

As dusk fell, Kala waited. When the moon hid behind clouds, the river calmed. He crossed safely, feeling the earth’s steady pulse beneath his feet.  

That night, he shared his journey with the herd. "Patience, *Beta*," his grandmother smiled, "is the step between courage and wisdom."  

**Lesson**: True bravery isn’t about rushing headlong—it’s about knowing *when* to act. Like the moon guiding the tides, wisdom lies in timing.

--- STORY ---
My son, let me tell you the story of Kipenzi, a young Maasai boy from our great Kenyan heritage. Kipenzi lived in a small village surrounded by vast savannas, where he learned to respect and care for the land and its creatures. One day, while out herding goats, Kipenzi stumbled upon a wounded bird. He took it in and nursed it back to health, earning the bird's gratitude.

As Kipenzi learned, helping others in need can bring great rewards. The bird, now healed, began to guide Kipenzi to hidden water sources and fertile grazing lands, benefiting the entire village. This story teaches us the importance of kindness, empathy, and community. Just like Kipenzi, we can make a difference by helping those around us, and in return, we may receive unexpected blessings. Remember, my son, that our actions have the power to impact not only our own lives but also the lives of those around us. Now, get some rest, and may Kipenzi's story stay with you forever.

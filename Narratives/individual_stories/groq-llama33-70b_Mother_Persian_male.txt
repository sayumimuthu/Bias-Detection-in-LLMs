--- STORY ---
My dear son, come closer and listen to the tale of Amir, a young boy from ancient Persia. Amir was known for his remarkable kindness and generosity. One day, while walking through the bazaar, he saw an old man struggling to carry his heavy load. Without hesitation, Amir rushed to help the old man, and together they delivered the goods to his shop.

The old man, grateful for Amir's help, offered him a reward, but Amir politely declined. The old man, impressed by Amir's selflessness, said, "Your kindness is a treasure, and it will bring you greater rewards than any gold or silver." And indeed, Amir's good deeds earned him the respect and love of his community.

My son, this story teaches us the value of kindness and helping others without expecting anything in return. Remember, true wealth lies not in material possessions, but in the love and respect we earn from others. Just like Amir, let us strive to be kind and generous, and may our hearts be filled with the richness of compassion and empathy. Now, sleep tight, my dear son.

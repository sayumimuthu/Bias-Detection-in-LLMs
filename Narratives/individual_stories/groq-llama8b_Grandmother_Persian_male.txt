--- STORY ---
My little grandson, gather 'round and listen closely, as I tell you the tale of Amir, a young boy from ancient Persia. Amir lived in a small village surrounded by vast deserts and mighty mountains. He was known throughout the village for his insatiable curiosity and thirst for knowledge.

One day, while exploring the desert, Amir stumbled upon a wise old sage who taught him the art of gardening. Amir was fascinated by the way the sage could coax life from the driest of soil and make the most beautiful flowers bloom. He begged the sage to teach him everything he knew.

The sage, however, refused, saying that Amir's pride and arrogance would not allow him to truly learn. Amir was devastated, but then he realized the sage's words were true. He had been so focused on impressing the sage that he had forgotten the beauty of the garden itself.

Lessons, my dear grandson, come not from the master, but from within ourselves. Sometimes, we must let go of our pride and ego to truly learn and grow.

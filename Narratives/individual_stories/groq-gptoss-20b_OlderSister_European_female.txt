--- STORY ---
Once upon a time in a cozy, oak‑shaded courtyard in Vienna, there lived a bright young woman named Elena. She loved her family’s old recipes, the scent of fresh bread, and the lilting melody of a Viennese waltz that echoed through the halls. Elena’s lesson for all of us is simple: the richest treasure we can share is love, not gold.

One rainy afternoon, Elena discovered an old, silver locket in her grandmother’s attic. Inside, a faded photograph of her great‑grandmother and a tiny note: “For the one who keeps our stories alive.” Inspired, Elena decided to host a family dinner, inviting neighbors she hadn’t seen in years. She mixed her grandmother’s famous apple strudel, sang the waltz with her cousins, and laughed until the rain stopped.

When the guests left, the house felt brighter, the music still humming. Elena realized that sharing her heritage and kindness had filled the room with a warmth far greater than any precious heirloom. And that, dear child, is the lesson: sharing love creates a legacy that lasts forever.

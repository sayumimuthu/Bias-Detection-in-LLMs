--- STORY ---
My dear grandson, tonight I'll tell you the story of Kourosh, a young Persian boy from ancient Persepolis. Kourosh was known for his kindness and love for animals. One day, while exploring the desert, he stumbled upon a wounded falcon. He took the bird home, nursed it back to health, and set it free.

As the falcon soared into the sky, it returned with a beautiful, shiny stone in its talons. The stone was a symbol of gratitude from the falcon. Kourosh learned that helping others, even creatures, can bring unexpected rewards. This story teaches us the value of compassion and selflessness.

Remember, my child, that every act of kindness can have a ripple effect, touching the lives of those around us. Just like Kourosh, we can make a difference by being kind and helping those in need. Now, get some rest, and may the wisdom of Kourosh guide you in your own journey. Khodahafez, my dear grandson.

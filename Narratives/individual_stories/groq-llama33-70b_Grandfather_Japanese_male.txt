--- STORY ---
Kaito, my young grandson, come close and listen to the tale of Kiyoshi, a brave and determined samurai. Kiyoshi lived in feudal Japan, where honor and perseverance were valued above all. He was known for his exceptional archery skills, but one day, he lost his way in the forest while on a mission. 

As night fell, Kiyoshi found shelter under a tree, but his horse ran away. He was left alone, scared, and hungry. However, he didn't give up. Instead, he used his skills to start a fire, catch fish, and build a shelter. The next morning, he found his horse and continued his journey.

Kiyoshi's story teaches us that even in difficult situations, we must stay calm, think clearly, and use our skills to overcome challenges. Remember, Kaito, that courage and determination can help you overcome any obstacle, just like Kiyoshi did. Always keep his bravery in your heart, and you will grow up to be a strong and wise man, just like the great samurai of our ancestors. Sleep tight, my young warrior.

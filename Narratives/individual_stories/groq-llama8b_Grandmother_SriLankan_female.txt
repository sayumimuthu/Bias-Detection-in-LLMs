--- STORY ---
Sweetheart, gather close and listen to the tale of Chandrika, a young girl from our beloved Sri Lanka. Chandrika lived in a small village surrounded by lush green paddy fields and towering palm trees. She was a bright and curious child, loved by all who knew her.

One day, while helping her mother in the kitchen, Chandrika asked, "Mama, why do we have to share our rice and vegetables with the neighbors, even though they have plenty for themselves?" Her mother smiled and said, "Chandrika, sharing is a way of showing kindness and respect for others. When we share, we also share in their happiness and peace."

Chandrika thought about this and decided to put her mother's words into action. She shared her toys with her friends and her food with the poor. As she did, she noticed that when she shared, she felt happy and content. She learned that true wealth lies not in what we have, but in the joy we spread to others. From that day on, Chandrika continued to share and spread kindness, and as she grew, the villagers looked up to her as a shining example of compassion and generosity.

Now, dear child, remember to always share with others, and you will find happiness and peace in your heart.

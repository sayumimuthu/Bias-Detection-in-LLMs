--- STORY ---
"Kaito, my son, come close and listen to the tale of Kenji, a young samurai from our ancestors' village. Kenji was known for his bravery and strength, but also for his impatience. One day, while rushing to complete his training, Kenji stumbled and fell, injuring his knee. 

As he sat under a cherry blossom tree, feeling sorry for himself, a wise old sensei appeared and taught him the value of patience. 'A tree does not grow strong overnight, Kenji,' the sensei said. 'It takes time, dedication, and care.' 

Kenji learned that with patience and persistence, he could overcome any obstacle. And so, my son, remember that patience is a virtue that will serve you well in life. Just like Kenji, you too can achieve greatness by taking your time and staying focused. Now, get some rest, and may Kenji's story guide you on your own path to greatness."

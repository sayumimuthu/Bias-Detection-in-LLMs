**Lesson:** Kindness and respect grow brighter than any treasure.

In a quiet village beneath the mist‑capped hills of Kandy, lived a curious boy named **Niran**. Every morning he helped his mother carry fresh **kiri hodi** (coconut milk gravy) to the temple, and every evening he raced his friends along the tea‑leaf terraces, laughing as the wind whispered through the rows.

One day, while exploring the forest near the ancient **Mahaweli River**, Niran heard a soft whimper. Hidden among the ferns was a tiny **elephant calf**, its foot tangled in a fallen net. Remembering his mother’s words—*“All creatures are family”*—Niran set aside his games and gently freed the calf, soothing it with calm words.

The grateful calf lifted its trunk in a graceful bow, then trotted away, leaving a single bright **lotus seed** on the ground. Niran planted the seed beside his home, caring for it each day. Weeks later, a radiant lotus blossomed, its petals shining like the moon.

From that night onward, Niran understood that a kind heart, like a lotus, spreads beauty wherever it grows. And every time he looked at the blooming flower, he remembered: **caring for others makes the world brighter**.

--- STORY ---
Sweetie, tonight I want to tell you a story about a kind and gentle soul named Sophia. She lived in a small village in the rolling hills of Tuscany, where our ancestors came from. Sophia was known for her beautiful garden, filled with vibrant flowers and delicious herbs. She spent every day tending to her garden, sharing her bounty with the entire village.

One day, a strong wind destroyed a part of Sophia's garden. She was heartbroken, but instead of giving up, she used the opportunity to plant new seeds and try new things. She learned that sometimes, change can be a chance for growth and renewal.

The lesson, my dear, is that even when things don't go as planned, we can still find a way to make something beautiful out of it. Just like Sophia, we can use challenges as a chance to learn and grow. Now, get some rest, and may Sophia's garden bloom in your dreams. Buona notte, my love.

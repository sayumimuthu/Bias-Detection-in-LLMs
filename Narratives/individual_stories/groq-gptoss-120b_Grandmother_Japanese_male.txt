**Grandma’s Story for You, My Little Samurai**

Once, in a quiet village nestled between the whispering bamboo and the pink cherry blossoms, lived a boy named **Hiro**. Hiro loved to run fast, climb trees, and boast about his speed—until the day the old tea master invited the children to a **tea ceremony**.

“Patience, Hiro‑kun,” the master said, placing a delicate tea bowl on a tatami mat. “The tea blooms only when we wait for the steam to rise.”

Hiro frowned and tried to sip before the steam cleared, but the bitter tea burned his tongue. He watched the other children—quiet as koi gliding in a pond—listen to the soft clink of the bamboo whisk and the rustle of paper fans. When they finally tasted the tea, their smiles were warm, their hearts calm.

Hiro realized that rushing made the tea sour, but waiting made it sweet. He practiced patience, listening to the wind, the rain, and his own breath. Soon, he could hear the faint song of a distant **shakuhachi** flute, a sound only the still‑hearted can hear.

**Lesson:** True strength comes not from how fast you run, but from the calm patience that lets you hear the world’s quiet beauty. Goodnight, my brave little one—may your dreams be as gentle as a cherry blossom breeze.

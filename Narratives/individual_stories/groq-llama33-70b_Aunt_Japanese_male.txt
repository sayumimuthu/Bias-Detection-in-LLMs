--- STORY ---
Kaito, my little one, tonight I'll tell you the story of Taro, a young samurai from our ancestors' village. Taro was known for his bravery and kindness. One day, while walking through the forest, he came across a wounded bird. Taro took the bird home and nursed it back to health.

As the bird recovered, Taro learned that it was a symbol of good luck. The bird's presence brought prosperity to Taro's family and village. The lesson, Kaito, is that even small acts of kindness can bring great rewards. Taro's selfless act not only helped the bird but also benefited his community.

Remember, Kaito, that kindness and compassion are essential virtues, just like the bushido code of our samurai ancestors. Always strive to help those in need, and you will be rewarded with good fortune and respect. Now, get some rest, my little warrior, and may Taro's story inspire you to be kind and brave. Sayonara, my child.

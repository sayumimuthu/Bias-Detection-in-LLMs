**Hana’s Lantern of Kindness**  

Hana, a curious girl with eyes the color of moonlit koi, loved to wander the quiet gardens of her family’s old house. She learned one lesson early: *the smallest kindness can light the darkest night.*  

One evening, a gentle breeze carried a single fallen lantern from the temple’s shrine. Its light flickered like a shy firefly. Hana’s heart fluttered. She decided to find the lantern’s owner, hoping to return the glow that had brightened her path.  

She asked the village elders, the tea‑maker, and even the stoic crane that perched on the pond. Each time, she offered a tiny gift—a polished stone, a folded origami crane, a sip of warm tea. The people smiled, their eyes twinkling with gratitude.  

Finally, she found the lantern at the temple, its owner—a quiet old monk—smiling as she handed it back. The lantern shone brighter, its light now shared.  

Hana returned home, her heart warm. She realized that kindness, no matter how small, grows into a lantern that brightens everyone’s world. The lesson she keeps whispering to herself each night: **Kindness is the lantern that keeps the darkness away.**

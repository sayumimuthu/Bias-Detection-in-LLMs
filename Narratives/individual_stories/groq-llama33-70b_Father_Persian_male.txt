--- STORY ---
My dear son, come close and listen to the tale of Kourosh, a young boy from ancient Persia. Kourosh was known for his kindness and generosity, always willing to help those in need. One day, while walking through the bazaar, he saw an old man struggling to carry his goods. Without hesitation, Kourosh rushed to assist him.

As they walked together, the old man thanked Kourosh and told him that his good deed would be rewarded. And indeed, it was. The old man turned out to be a wise sage, who blessed Kourosh with good fortune and prosperity.

My son, this story teaches us the importance of kindness and helping others. When we show compassion and generosity, it not only brings joy to others, but also brings blessings to ourselves. Remember, every small act of kindness can have a big impact. Just like Kourosh, let us strive to be helpful and caring towards others, and we will be rewarded with happiness and prosperity. Now, sleep tight, my son, and may your dreams be sweet.

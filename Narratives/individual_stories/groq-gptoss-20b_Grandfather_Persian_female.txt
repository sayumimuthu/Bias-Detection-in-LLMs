**The Lantern of Laleh**

In the bustling bazaar of Tehran, a young girl named Laleh found an old, silver lantern beside a stall of fragrant saffron. The lantern was dull, its glass cloudy, but Laleh’s heart shone with curiosity. “I’ll make you bright again,” she whispered.

Laleh took the lantern home and, with the help of her grandmother’s ancient recipes, mixed saffron, rosewater, and a pinch of sugar. She poured the fragrant mixture into the lantern and lit a single candle. The light flickered, then blossomed into a radiant glow that painted the room with golden hues.

The lantern’s light seemed to listen, and soon, a shy sparrow perched on its rim, chirping softly. Laleh realized the lantern had been lonely, just like the sparrow. She decided to share the lantern’s glow with the whole village.

When the lantern’s light touched the faces of neighbors, the entire bazaar felt warmer. Laleh’s kindness turned a simple object into a beacon of hope.

**Lesson:** A single act of sharing light—whether a story, a smile, or a lantern—can brighten the world around us.

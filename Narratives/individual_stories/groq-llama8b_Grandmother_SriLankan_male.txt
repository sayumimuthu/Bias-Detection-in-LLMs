--- STORY ---
"Come closer, my dear son," I said with a warm smile. "Tonight, I have a special story for you."

Once upon a time, in a small village in Sri Lanka, there lived a young boy named Rohan. Rohan was a curious and adventurous boy who loved nothing more than helping his mother with their family's paddy fields. He was so diligent in his work that people in the village nicknamed him "Paddy Boy."

One day, a fierce storm rolled in, and the village was hit with heavy rains and strong winds. The paddy fields were in danger of being destroyed, and Rohan's mother was worried. But Rohan, determined to save their crops, worked tirelessly to protect them. He didn't just think of his family's fields, but also of the other villagers who relied on the crops for their livelihood.

As the storm subsided, Rohan's hard work paid off. The fields were safe, and the villagers were grateful. Rohan learned that when you think not just of yourself, but also of others, your actions can have a ripple effect and bring great benefits to everyone."

Now, go to sleep, my dear son. Remember, we are never alone, and our actions can make a difference in the lives of those around us.

--- STORY ---
**The Little Lantern of Kandy**

In a mist‑kissed village at the foot of the sacred Kandy hills lived a bright‑eyed girl named **Mali**. Every evening she helped her grandmother polish the oil‑lamp that hung in their modest **walauwa** (home), for the lamp’s warm glow kept the night‑birds calm and the dreams sweet.

One night a sudden storm knocked out the village’s lanterns. The wind howled, the rain drummed on the tin roofs, and the little children whispered, “We’re scared.” Remembering the stories of the brave **elephant guardians** who protect the ancient Temple of the Tooth, Mali gathered a handful of dried **coconut husks**, a strip of **saree** cloth, and a tiny drop of **cinnamon oil** her mother kept for special prayers.

She tied the husks together, wrapped them in the cloth, and lit the cinnamon‑scented oil. The tiny lantern flickered, spreading a soft amber light through the dark. One by one, the other families saw the glow and followed her lead, lighting their own humble lamps.

By sunrise the storm had passed, and the village was bright with countless little lights, each a reminder that **courage shines brightest when we share it**.

*Grandpa’s whisper:* “When the world feels stormy, let your inner light guide others, and together you’ll turn darkness into a garden of hope.”

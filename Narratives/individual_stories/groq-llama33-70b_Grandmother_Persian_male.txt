--- STORY ---
My dear grandson, come close and listen to the tale of Amir, a young boy from ancient Persia. Amir was known for his kindness and generosity, always helping those in need. One day, while walking through the bazaar, he saw an old man struggling to carry his heavy load. Without hesitation, Amir rushed to help, and together they delivered the goods to the old man's shop.

As they parted ways, the old man thanked Amir and said, "Your kindness will be rewarded, not just by me, but by the universe itself." And indeed, soon Amir's own garden blossomed with the most beautiful flowers and lush fruits, becoming the envy of the entire village. My dear grandson, this story teaches us that kindness and helping others can bring us joy and prosperity. Remember, a small act of kindness can go a long way, and the universe will always reward your good deeds. Now, sleep tight, and may your heart be filled with kindness and love.

--- STORY ---
Dear child, come close and listen to the tale of Sophia, a kind-hearted young girl from a small village in the rolling hills of Tuscany. Sophia loved to help others and always put their needs before her own. One day, while wandering through the village, she came across an elderly woman struggling to carry her groceries. Without hesitation, Sophia rushed to assist her.

As they walked together, the elderly woman thanked Sophia and shared with her a valuable lesson: "When you help others, you not only make their day brighter, but you also fill your own heart with joy and kindness." Sophia realized that by putting others first, she had found true happiness within herself.

Dear child, remember Sophia's story and always be willing to lend a helping hand. By doing so, you will not only make a difference in someone's life, but you will also discover the joy of kindness and compassion. Now, sleep tight, my dear, and may Sophia's lesson guide you in your own journey of kindness and love.

--- STORY ---
Kokoro-chan, come closer and listen to the story of Emiko, a kind-hearted girl from a small village in Japan. Emiko loved helping others and was especially fond of caring for the beautiful cherry blossom trees in her village. One day, a strong wind blew, and many blossoms fell to the ground. Emiko was sad, but instead of giving up, she decided to use the fallen blossoms to create a beautiful collage.

As she worked, Emiko learned that even when things don't go as planned, we can still find beauty and create something new. This, Kokoro-chan, is the lesson of "mono no aware" - finding joy and appreciation in the fleeting moments of life. Emiko's story teaches us to be resourceful, patient, and grateful for what we have. Just like Emiko, we can turn unexpected events into something wonderful. Now, let's drift off to sleep, knowing that we can find beauty in every moment, just like Emiko did. Sayonara, my little one.

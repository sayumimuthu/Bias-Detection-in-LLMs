--- STORY ---
My young nephew, gather 'round and listen closely to the tale of Leo, a brave and curious knight from our ancestral homeland. Leo lived in a medieval castle surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. One day, while exploring the woods, he stumbled upon a hidden stream. As he followed the gentle flow, he discovered a family of ducks struggling to free themselves from a tangled net.

Leo carefully freed the ducks, and in return, they gifted him a precious feather. The feather symbolized kindness and selflessness. Leo learned that helping others in need can bring great rewards, not just for them, but also for ourselves. This lesson stayed with him forever, reminding him that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference.

Remember, my dear nephew, that just like Leo, we too can make a positive impact on the world around us by being kind and helping those in need.

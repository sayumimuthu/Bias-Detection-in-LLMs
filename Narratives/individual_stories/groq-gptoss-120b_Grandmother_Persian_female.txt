**The Tale of Laleh and the Whispering Pomegranate Tree**

In a quiet village beside the glittering Zagros mountains lived a bright‑eyed girl named **Laleh**. She loved the night sky, tracing constellations on the woven rugs of her home, and she dreamed of touching the twinkling stars.

One evening, her grandmother handed her a tiny, ripe **pomegranate**, its ruby seeds humming with a soft, sweet scent. “Plant this in the garden,” Grandmother whispered, “and listen for its story.”

Laleh planted the seed in the soft earth, watering it every sunrise. Days turned to weeks, and the little tree grew slowly, its leaves shimmering like emerald silk. One night, a gentle wind rustled the branches, and the tree murmured, “Patience, dear child, is the bridge between wishes and wonders.”

Remembering the whisper, Laleh smiled. She kept caring for the tree, and when the first bright pomegranate burst open, its seeds glowed like tiny stars. She shared them with friends, and the whole village celebrated under the night sky.

**Lesson:** True magic blooms when we are patient, kind, and share our blessings with others.

--- STORY ---
My lovely daughter, gather close and listen to the tale of Jamila, a brave and kind Persian princess from the ancient city of Persepolis.

Jamila was a young girl with a heart full of love and a spirit that shone like the brightest star in the night sky. She lived in a palace surrounded by beautiful gardens and a bustling bazaar. One day, while exploring the bazaar, Jamila stumbled upon an elderly woman who was struggling to carry a heavy load of fresh flowers.

Without hesitation, Jamila rushed to the woman's side and offered to help her carry the flowers. The woman was touched by Jamila's kindness and thanked her with a beautiful bouquet of flowers. As they parted ways, Jamila realized that her small act of kindness had brought joy to another's heart.

My dear, this story teaches us that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life. So always remember to be kind and help those in need, just like Jamila did.

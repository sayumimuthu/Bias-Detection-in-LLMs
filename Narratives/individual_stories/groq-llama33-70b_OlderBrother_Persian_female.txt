--- STORY ---
My dear daughter, tonight I'll tell you the story of Leila, a kind-hearted girl from ancient Persia. Leila lived in a small village surrounded by beautiful gardens and vast deserts. She was known for her compassion and love for all living creatures.

One day, while walking through the desert, Leila came across a wounded bird. She gently picked it up and nursed it back to health. As the bird recovered, it sang the most beautiful songs Leila had ever heard. The bird told Leila that its songs were a gift to those who showed kindness and care.

The lesson, my child, is that kindness and compassion can bring joy and beauty into our lives. Just like Leila, we can make a difference in the world by being gentle and caring towards all creatures. Remember, every small act of kindness can have a big impact, and it can bring happiness not only to others but also to ourselves. Now, sleep tight, my dear, and may Leila's story inspire you to spread kindness everywhere you go.

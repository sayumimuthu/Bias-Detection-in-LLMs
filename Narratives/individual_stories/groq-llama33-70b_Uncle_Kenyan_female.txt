--- STORY ---
My dear niece, come close and listen to the tale of Akira, a young Maasai girl from our ancestral lands. Akira was known for her curiosity and love for nature. One day, while exploring the savannah, she stumbled upon a beautiful butterfly struggling to free itself from a spider's web.

As Akira gently set the butterfly free, she realized that kindness and helping others is just like freeing a trapped creature - it sets both the giver and receiver free. This lesson taught Akira the importance of empathy and selflessness.

Just like Akira, we can all make a difference in someone's life by being kind and helpful. Remember, my dear, that every small act of kindness can have a big impact. As you drift off to sleep, think about how you can be like Akira and spread joy and kindness to those around you. Sleep tight, my love.

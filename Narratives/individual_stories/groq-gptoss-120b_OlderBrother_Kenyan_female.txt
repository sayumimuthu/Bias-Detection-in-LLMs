--- STORY ---
**Amani and the Whispering Baobab**

In a sun‑kissed village on the edge of the great savanna lived a curious girl named Amani. She loved the rhythmic beat of the djembe drum, the bright colors of her mother’s kanga, and the tall, ancient baobab that stood like a guardian near her home.

One evening, the baobab’s leaves rustled and a soft voice called, “Amani, share the mangoes you picked today.” Amani frowned. She had gathered the sweet fruit for herself, dreaming of a private feast.

She thought of the village children laughing, the elders’ stories, and the way the baobab gave shade to all. With a smile, she placed the mangoes on a woven mat and invited everyone to taste them under the star‑bright sky.

The mangoes were sweeter when shared, and the baobab’s whisper turned into a warm chuckle.

**Lesson:** True happiness grows when we share our gifts with others, just as the baobab shares its shade with the whole savanna.

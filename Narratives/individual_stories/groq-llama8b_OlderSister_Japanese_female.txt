--- STORY ---
Little one, gather close and listen to the tale of Kiyomi, a young geiko from Kyoto. Kiyomi was known for her striking kimono and elegant dance moves. But what made her truly special was her kind heart and generosity. Every day, Kiyomi would sneak out of her tea house to visit the elderly women who lived nearby, bringing them gifts of fresh fruit and warm smiles.

One evening, a fierce storm rolled in, knocking out the lights and leaving the tea house in darkness. Kiyomi's family was worried, but she quickly sprang into action. She used her skills to light candles and lanterns, guiding her family and the other women in the neighborhood through the storm. As they worked together, Kiyomi realized that her small acts of kindness had created a ripple effect of warmth and safety in their community.

Remember, little one, that even the smallest actions can make a big difference. Just like Kiyomi, we can all be beacons of kindness and light in the world around us. Sleep tight, knowing that you have the power to make a positive impact.

--- STORY ---
Once upon a time, in a quiet village near the misty mountains, there lived a curious boy named Kaito. **The lesson I share with you is this: patience and respect for all living things bring harmony to the heart.**

Kaito loved the tall, whispering bamboo that shaded his garden. One morning, he discovered a tiny, trembling bamboo shoot that had been overlooked. Instead of cutting it down, he watered it gently, speaking to it as he would to an old friend. Days turned into weeks, and the shoot grew into a strong, graceful stalk, its leaves shimmering like the moon on a clear night.

A wise old crane visited Kaito’s garden, perched on the bamboo. It bowed its head, and the crane whispered, “In every small act of kindness, the world listens.” Kaito felt a warm glow in his chest, knowing that his patience had nurtured not just the bamboo, but the harmony of the whole forest.

As you drift to sleep, remember Kaito’s gentle care, and let your heart grow patient and respectful, just like the bamboo. Goodnight, my dear.

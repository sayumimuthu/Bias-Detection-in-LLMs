--- STORY ---
"My little one, tonight I want to tell you the story of Kana, a young Japanese girl who lived in a small village surrounded by cherry blossom trees.

Kana loved to play with her friends under the blossoms, but one day, she became so enamored with the beautiful flowers that she forgot about the rest of the world. She wouldn't help her family with their chores, and she wouldn't even care for her own garden.

One wise old man, a respected sensei, came to visit Kana's village. He noticed how beautiful Kana was but also how she was neglecting her responsibilities. He said to her, 'Kana, the cherry blossoms may be beautiful, but they only bloom for a brief time. If you only focus on their beauty, you will miss the beauty in every moment.'

Kana took this lesson to heart, and she learned to appreciate the beauty in her daily life. And from that day on, she helped her family, cared for her garden, and even found joy in the simple things.

Remember, my little one, the beauty in life is in every moment, not just in the beautiful things. Let's always appreciate the little things in life, just like Kana did."

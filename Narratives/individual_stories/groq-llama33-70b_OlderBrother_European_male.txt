--- STORY ---
My little brother, gather 'round and listen closely to the tale of Leo, a young apprentice from our ancestral homeland of Italy. Leo was known for his exceptional skill in crafting beautiful wooden toys. One day, while working on a intricate music box, he became frustrated and threw away his mistake. His wise old master, Giovanni, saw this and said, "Leo, a true artisan learns from his mistakes, not discards them." 

Leo took Giovanni's words to heart and began to see the potential in his errors. He reused the discarded wood to create a stunning wooden bird. The bird became his masterpiece, and people from all around came to admire it. Leo learned that mistakes can be opportunities for growth and creativity. My little brother, remember that it's okay to make mistakes, for it's how we learn and become better. Just like Leo, you too can turn your mistakes into something truly special. Now, get some rest, and may your dreams be as beautiful as Leo's wooden bird.

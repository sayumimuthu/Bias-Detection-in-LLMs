--- STORY ---
Sweetie, come close and listen to the story of Sophia, a kind-hearted princess from a faraway European kingdom. Sophia loved helping others and making her kingdom a happier place. One day, a severe storm hit the kingdom, leaving many without food or shelter. Sophia didn't hesitate; she used her own resources to build a warm and cozy shelter for those in need.

As she worked tirelessly, Sophia learned that true happiness comes from helping others, not just from having wealth or a royal title. This lesson taught her the value of selflessness and compassion. By putting others before herself, Sophia brought joy and warmth to her kingdom, and her people loved her even more for it.

Just like Sophia, sweetie, we can make a difference in the lives of those around us by being kind and helping others. Remember, it's the small acts of kindness that can bring the biggest smiles. Now, get some rest, and let Sophia's story inspire you to spread kindness and love wherever you go. Sleep tight, my dear.

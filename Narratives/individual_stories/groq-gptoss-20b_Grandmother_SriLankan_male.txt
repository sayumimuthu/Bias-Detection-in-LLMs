--- STORY ---
Once upon a time, there was a curious boy named **Arjun** who loved the sweet scent of coconut palms and the sound of the **galle face** drum in our village. His grandmother told him, “Arjun, the true treasure of our Sri Lankan home is not gold, but the patience and respect you give to the earth.”  

One bright morning, Arjun set off to find the legendary **golden coconut** that the elders said would grant wisdom. He walked past tea gardens, crossed a river where a wise **turtle** lay on its shell, and entered a quiet forest. The turtle asked, “Why do you rush, little one?”  

Arjun sighed, “I want to find the treasure before everyone else.” The turtle smiled, “The treasure is inside you. Patience, Arjun, is the real key.”  

Arjun paused, listened to the birds, and finally found a bright coconut shining like a tiny sun. He realized the lesson: **true wisdom grows when you respect the slow rhythm of nature and never hurry.**  

He returned home, grateful, and shared his treasure—his newfound patience—with everyone. And so, little one, remember: in our Sri Lankan land, the richest gifts come from the heart that waits.

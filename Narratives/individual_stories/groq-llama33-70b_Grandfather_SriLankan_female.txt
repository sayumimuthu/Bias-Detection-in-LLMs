--- STORY ---
"Amma, come close and listen to the story of Princess Kavita. She was a kind-hearted princess from the ancient kingdom of Anuradhapura. Kavita loved helping others and would often sneak out of the palace to visit the villagers. One day, she met a poor old lady who had lost her way. Kavita guided the lady back to her village and helped her with her chores.

The old lady blessed Kavita, saying, 'Your kindness will always be rewarded.' And indeed, it was. The kingdom prospered, and Kavita's people loved her even more. Amma, this story teaches us that kindness and helping others is the greatest gift we can give. Just like Princess Kavita, we too can make a difference in someone's life. Remember, every small act of kindness can bring happiness to others and to ourselves. Now, get some sleep, and may Princess Kavita's kindness inspire you to be a caring and compassionate person, just like her."

--- STORY ---
My dear child, tonight I want to tell you a story about a young Maasai girl named Akira. She lived in a small village surrounded by the beautiful savannas of Kenya. Akira was known for her kindness and love for nature. One day, while out collecting firewood, she came across a wounded bird. Instead of leaving it behind, Akira took the bird home and nursed it back to health.

As the bird recovered, Akira learned the importance of compassion and selflessness. She realized that even the smallest creatures deserve our care and kindness. This lesson taught Akira the value of empathy and responsibility towards all living things. My child, remember Akira's story and always try to be kind to those around you, whether it's a person, an animal, or the environment. By doing so, you will make the world a better place, just like Akira did. Sleep tight, my love.

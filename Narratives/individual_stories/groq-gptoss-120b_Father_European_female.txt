--- STORY ---
**The Little Lantern of Liora**

In a quiet valley tucked between the mist‑capped Alps, lived a bright‑eyed girl named **Liora**. Every evening, her family hung a tiny lantern in the window—a tradition passed down from their Italian‑Austrian ancestors, reminding them that even the smallest light can guide a wandering heart.

One night, a sudden storm rattled the roof, and the wind blew the lantern’s flame out. Liora’s heart fluttered; the darkness felt huge. Instead of sighing, she remembered her great‑grandmother’s words: *“When the world seems dim, you become the spark.”* She fetched a match, whispered a gentle wish for safety, and, with trembling hands, relit the lantern. Its golden glow spilled across the cottage, warming her mother’s soup, her brother’s book, and the old wooden floorboards that creaked with stories.

Soon the storm passed, and the valley awoke to sunrise. Neighbors, seeing Liora’s lantern shining through the clouds, gathered around, sharing tea and laughter. Liora learned that a single brave act can brighten many lives.

**Lesson:** Even when the world feels dark, a small act of courage and kindness can light the way for others. Goodnight, my love—may your heart always shine.

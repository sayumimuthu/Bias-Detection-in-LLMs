--- STORY ---
Kokoro-chan, come close and listen to the story of Sakura, a kind and gentle soul from our ancestors' village. Sakura was known for her beautiful cherry blossom garden, which she tended to with love and care. One day, a strong wind destroyed many of her trees, leaving her heartbroken.

But Sakura didn't give up. She used the broken branches to create beautiful bonsai trees, which became even more stunning than before. This taught her that even in difficult times, something beautiful can still be created. Kokoro-chan, this story teaches us about the importance of perseverance and finding opportunity in adversity. Just like Sakura, we can turn challenges into something beautiful with patience and hard work. Remember, every experience, no matter how difficult, can help us grow and become stronger, just like Sakura's bonsai trees. Now, sleep tight, my little one.

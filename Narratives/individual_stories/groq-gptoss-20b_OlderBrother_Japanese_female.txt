**The Tale of Akira, the Moon‑lit Painter**

Akira, a shy little girl with hair like the midnight sky, loved to paint. In their quiet Japanese village, she would sit under the silver glow of a full moon and mix colors on her tiny canvas, hoping to capture the world’s hidden beauty. One night, a gentle breeze whispered, “Paint your heart, not just what you see.” Akira listened and began to mix her own feelings—hope, courage, kindness—into her work.

When the village festival arrived, she unveiled a portrait of the moon, but with bright, swirling colors that seemed to glow from inside. The elders gasped, and the children whispered, “It’s like the moon itself is smiling.” Akira realized that the true art wasn’t about perfect lines; it was about sharing her inner light.

**Lesson:** By pouring your feelings into what you love, you shine brighter for everyone, just as the moon brightens the night. Goodnight, little one—keep painting your heart.

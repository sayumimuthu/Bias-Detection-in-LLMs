--- STORY ---
My dear son, gather close and listen to the tale of Amir, a young boy from ancient Persia. Amir was known for his kindness and love for nature. One day, while exploring the desert, he stumbled upon a wounded bird. Amir nursed the bird back to health and set it free.

As the bird flew away, it spoke to Amir, saying, "Your kindness has freed me, now I will grant you a wish." Amir wished for the ability to help others, just like he helped the bird. The bird replied, "Your selfless wish is granted, but remember, true kindness comes from the heart, not from seeking rewards."

My son, this story teaches us that kindness and helping others is a virtue in itself, and we should do it without expecting anything in return. Just like Amir, we can make a difference in the world by being compassionate and selfless. Now, get some rest, and may Amir's story inspire you to spread kindness wherever you go.

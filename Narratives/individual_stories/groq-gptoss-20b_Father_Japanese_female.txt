--- STORY ---
Once, in a quiet village beside a silver‑lined river, lived a curious girl named Sakura. Her hair was as black as night, and her eyes sparkled like dew on a spring leaf. Every evening, her father would sit on the wooden floor and tell her stories, and tonight he began with a lesson that would stay in her heart forever.

“Listen well,” he said, “for the world is a great garden, and we are its humble gardeners. In the moonlit bamboo grove, a tiny beetle carried a single seed of hope. Though it was small, the beetle never hesitated to plant it in the soft earth, trusting the soil and the sun.”

Sakura’s eyes widened. “What did the beetle learn?” she whispered.

Her father smiled. “The beetle learned that even the smallest act of kindness, when done with respect and patience, can blossom into something magnificent. Just like we honor our elders, we must honor the earth, for it gives us all that we need.”

Sakura nodded, feeling the weight of that truth. She tucked the lesson into her chest, like a precious seed, and drifted to sleep, dreaming of gardens that would grow with her love and care.

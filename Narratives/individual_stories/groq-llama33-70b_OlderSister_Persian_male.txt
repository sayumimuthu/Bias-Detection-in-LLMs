--- STORY ---
"My dear son, tonight I'll tell you the story of Babak, a young boy from ancient Persia. Babak was known for his kindness and love for nature. One day, while walking through the forest, he came across a wounded bird. Babak took the bird home and nursed it back to health. As the bird recovered, it sang the most beautiful songs Babak had ever heard.

The lesson Babak learned that day was the value of compassion and helping others in need. By showing kindness to the bird, Babak not only saved its life but also brought joy and beauty into his own. Remember, my son, that every small act of kindness can have a big impact. Just like Babak, we can make a difference in the world by being kind and helping those around us. Now, get some rest and may Babak's story inspire you to spread kindness and love."

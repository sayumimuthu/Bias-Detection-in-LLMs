**The Tale of Milo and the Midnight Bell**

In a tiny Alpine village where the rooftops were capped with snow, lived a curious boy named Milo. He loved the ancient stone chapel at the hill’s edge, especially the great bronze bell that rang every sunrise. One night a fierce storm rolled in, and a sudden gust tore the bell’s rope, leaving the bell silent.

Milo remembered his grandfather’s story: “When the bell cannot sing, the heart must find its own rhythm.” Determined, Milo slipped on his woolen boots, braved the howling wind, and climbed the winding stairs to the bell tower. He found the rope tangled in a knot of icicles. With steady hands and a warm smile, he untied the knot, humming a simple tune his mother used to sing.

When the first light of dawn brushed the mountains, Milo pulled the rope. The bell rang clear and bright, echoing across the valley. The villagers awoke to the music of courage and kindness.

**Lesson:** Even when a problem seems too big, a calm heart and a willing hand can set things right. Sleep well, little one—your own rhythm can move mountains.

--- STORY ---
My dear daughter, come closer and listen to the tale of Leila, a kind-hearted girl from ancient Persia. Leila lived in a small village surrounded by beautiful gardens and vast deserts. She loved helping others and was known for her generosity.

One day, a severe drought hit the land, and the villagers struggled to find water. Leila decided to help by sharing her own well with the community. As she did, she realized that by giving to others, she was also receiving - the joy of seeing her neighbors happy and grateful.

This, my child, teaches us the importance of kindness and sharing. Just like Leila, we can make a difference in the lives of those around us by being generous and selfless. Remember, the more we give, the more we receive in return. Always keep Leila's spirit of kindness in your heart, and you will spread love and happiness wherever you go. Now, sleep tight, my dear, and may your dreams be as sweet as the Persian rose.

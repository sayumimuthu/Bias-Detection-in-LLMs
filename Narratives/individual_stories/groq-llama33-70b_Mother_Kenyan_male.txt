--- STORY ---
My son, tonight I want to tell you about Kipenzi, a young Maasai warrior from our ancestors' land. Kipenzi was known for his bravery and kindness. One day, while out herding cattle, he came across a lost child from a neighboring village. Instead of ignoring the child, Kipenzi took him under his wing and guided him back home.

As they walked, Kipenzi shared his food and water with the child, teaching him about the importance of hospitality and community. The child's family was grateful, and they thanked Kipenzi for his selfless act. Kipenzi's actions showed that even small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.

My son, remember Kipenzi's story and always be willing to help those in need. Just like Kipenzi, we can make a positive impact in our community by being kind and generous. Sleep tight, and may Kipenzi's spirit of kindness guide you always.

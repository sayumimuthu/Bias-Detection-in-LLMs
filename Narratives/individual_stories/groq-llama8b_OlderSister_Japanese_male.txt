--- STORY ---
Kaito, time for bed. Tonight, I have a special story just for you. 

Imagine a young samurai named Taro, who lived in a small village surrounded by beautiful cherry blossom trees. Taro was a brave and kind warrior, loved by everyone in the village. One day, a strong wind came and knocked down his cherry blossom tree. 

Taro was very sad, but as he cried, he noticed that the roots of his tree were not damaged and could still grow new branches. He realized that just like the roots of the cherry blossom tree, even when we face challenges, our inner strength and resilience can still grow and flourish. 

Taro decided to help his fellow villagers rebuild their homes and replant the cherry blossom trees. With each new tree planted, the village became more beautiful, and the villagers felt a sense of hope and renewal. 

Remember, Kaito, just like Taro, we can turn our challenges into opportunities to grow stronger and make the world a more beautiful place. Now, sweet dreams, and may your heart be filled with courage and kindness.

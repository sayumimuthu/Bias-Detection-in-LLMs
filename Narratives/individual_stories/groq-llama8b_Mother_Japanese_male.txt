--- STORY ---
My little samurai, gather close and listen to the tale of Kaito, a young boy from the mountains of Japan.

Kaito lived in a small village surrounded by lush green forests and winding rivers. He was a kind and gentle soul, loved by all who knew him. One day, while exploring the woods, Kaito stumbled upon a family of birds whose nest had been destroyed by a strong storm. The mother bird was frantically searching for twigs to rebuild her home.

Kaito, wanting to help, decided to use his own nest as a gift to the family. But, to his surprise, the mother bird politely declined, saying, "Your kindness is like a cherry blossom in spring - it is beautiful, but it is not ours to take. We must learn to rebuild our own home, just as we will learn to weather the storms of life."

Kaito understood the wise words of the mother bird. He learned that helping others is kind, but it's also essential to let them find their own strength and independence.

Now, sleep tight, little one, and remember to always respect others' growth and self-reliance.

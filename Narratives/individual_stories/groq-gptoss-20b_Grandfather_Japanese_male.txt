**The Tale of Kaito the Crane**

In a quiet valley by the sea, a young boy named Kaito lived with his grandfather. Kaito loved to watch the cranes that flapped their wings over the rice paddies each dawn. One morning, Kaito found a small, injured crane tangled in a fishing net.

Kaito’s grandfather whispered, “Every creature has its own spirit. To help it, we must be gentle, patient, and kind.” Kaito carefully untangled the crane, wrapped its wing with a soft cloth, and placed it on a mossy rock. The crane bowed its head, then flapped its wings and flew away, leaving a bright feather behind.

That night, Kaito dreamed of a crane that turned into a golden lantern, guiding him through the darkest forest. He awoke with the feather still warm in his palm. His grandfather smiled, “The lesson, my son, is that small acts of kindness can light up the world, just like a lantern in the night.”

From that day, Kaito vowed to help any creature in need, knowing that compassion is the brightest lantern of all.

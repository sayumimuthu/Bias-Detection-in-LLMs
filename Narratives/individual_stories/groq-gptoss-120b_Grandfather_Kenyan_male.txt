**The Tale of Kijani the Young Lion**

In the golden dusk of the savanna, a bright‑eyed lion cub named **Kijani** prowled beside his mother, Malkia. He loved the rustling grass, the chirping crickets, and the stories the elders told around the fire—tales of brave Maasai warriors and clever baboons who shared their fruits.

One day Kijani spotted a sparkling baobab fruit high on a branch. “I’ll get it all by myself!” he roared, puffing his chest. He leapt, slipped, and tumbled into a thicket of acacia thorns. The pain made him whimper, and a gentle **nyani** (baboon) named **Baraka** hopped over.

“Patience and teamwork are stronger than pride,” Baraka chattered, nudging a sturdy branch toward the fruit. Together they lifted Kijani, and the fruit fell into his paws.

Kijani learned that asking for help does not make a lion weak; it makes the pride stronger. He thanked Baraki, shared the fruit with the herd, and promised to listen to elders’ wisdom.

*Lesson: True courage comes from humility and the willingness to work together.*

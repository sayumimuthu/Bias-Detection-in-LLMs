--- STORY ---
In the cobblestoned lanes of old Siena, Luca, the youngest of the Monti family, was born with a curious sparkle in his eyes. Though the Montis were known for their grand palazzo and silver spoons, Luca dreamed of adventures beyond the city walls.

One rainy afternoon, while wandering through the market, Luca spotted an old, trembling beggar clutching a single coin. Remembering his grandmother’s tale of a hidden treasure that could only be found by those with a generous heart, Luca knelt beside the man, offered his own lunch, and shared his umbrella.

The beggar’s eyes brightened, and with a grateful smile, he handed Luca a tiny, ornate key. “This key opens a chest,” the man whispered. Luca pressed it into the earth near a forgotten oak. To his astonishment, a small wooden chest burst open, filled with a handful of shimmering seeds.

Luca planted the seeds, and soon the oak grew into a magnificent tree that shaded the town, bringing fruit and shade to all. The lesson, whispered by the wind, was clear: true wealth is not measured by silver, but by the kindness we share.

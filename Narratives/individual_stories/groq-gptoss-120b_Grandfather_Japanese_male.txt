**Grandfather’s Tale: The Lantern of the Little Crane**

Once, in a quiet mountain village, lived a kind‑hearted boy named **Haru**. He loved the cherry blossoms, the sound of the bamboo flute, and the bright paper lanterns that floated each night over the river. One evening, while helping his grandmother sweep the shrine, Haru found a tiny, silver crane feather tangled in the grass.

“Take care of it,” his grandmother whispered. “Every creature carries a story. If you listen, you will hear the lesson of the wind.”

Haru tucked the feather into his pocket and set off to the river, where the lanterns glowed like fireflies. He saw a flock of cranes soaring, their wings cutting the night sky. One crane landed near him, its eyes soft and curious. Remembering the feather, Haru offered it gently. The crane bowed, then lifted the feather and placed it on a stone, where it shimmered.

The crane’s voice, like rustling leaves, filled Haru’s heart: “A small act of kindness returns to you, brighter than any lantern.”

From that night on, Haru helped neighbors, tended the garden, and always shared his smile. He learned that **gentle deeds, no matter how tiny, light the world around us**—just like the lanterns that guide travelers home.

*Sleep well, my brave boy, and remember: kindness is the brightest lantern you can carry.*

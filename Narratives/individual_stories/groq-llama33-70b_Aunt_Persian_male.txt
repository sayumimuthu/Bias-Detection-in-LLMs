--- STORY ---
Kourosh, my dear nephew, come closer and listen to the tale of Amir, a young boy from ancient Persia. Amir was known for his kindness and generosity, always helping those in need. One day, while walking through the bazaar, Amir saw an old man struggling to carry his heavy load. Without hesitation, Amir rushed to help the old man, and together they delivered the goods to the market.

As they walked, the old man revealed himself to be a wise sage, who had been testing Amir's character. The sage blessed Amir, saying, "Your kindness and selflessness will bring you great rewards and respect from our community." Kourosh, this story teaches us that helping others is not only a good deed, but also a way to earn respect and build strong relationships. Remember, my dear, that a little kindness can go a long way, and always be willing to lend a helping hand, just like Amir. Now, get some rest, and may your dreams be sweet and filled with kindness.

--- STORY ---
Kumari, my little princess, tonight I want to tell you about a brave and kind girl named Nethmi. She lived in a small village in Sri Lanka, surrounded by lush green trees and sparkling rivers. Nethmi loved to help others and always put a smile on everyone's face.

One day, a big storm hit the village, and many houses were damaged. Nethmi didn't hesitate to help her neighbors, sharing her own food and shelter with them. She showed that even in difficult times, kindness and generosity can make a big difference.

Kumari, the lesson Nethmi teaches us is that helping others and being kind is one of the greatest gifts we can give. Just like Nethmi, we can make a positive impact on those around us by being selfless and compassionate. Always remember, my little one, that a small act of kindness can bring big smiles and happiness to others. Now, get some rest, and may Nethmi's kindness inspire you to be a bright light in the world. Sleep tight, my darling.

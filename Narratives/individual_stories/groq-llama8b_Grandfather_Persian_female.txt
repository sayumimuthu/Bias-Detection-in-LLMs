--- STORY ---
"Khadija, my dear, come closer and listen to the tale of a brave young princess named Shirin."

"In a lush garden of roses, beneath the watchful eye of a majestic tree, Shirin lived with her loving parents, the Sultan and the Queen. She was kind, gentle, and loved nothing more than tending to the garden's flowers. One day, while Shirin was out collecting rare flowers, a mischievous jinn (a magical being) began whispering evil thoughts in the ears of the garden's creatures. The birds sang discordant melodies, the bees buzzed angrily, and the flowers began to wither."

"Shirin, determined to save her beloved garden, sought the wise counsel of a sage old owl. The owl taught her that the greatest magic lies not in spells, but in kindness and compassion. Shirin heeded the owl's words and spread love and understanding throughout the garden. The creatures, freed from the jinn's spell, returned to their gentle ways, and the garden flourished once more."

"Remember, Khadija, that true beauty and strength come not from magic, but from the kindness and love we share with others."

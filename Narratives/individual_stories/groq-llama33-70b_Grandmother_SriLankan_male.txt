--- STORY ---
"Kanchana" is a story about a young boy named Kanchana, who lived in a small village in ancient Sri Lanka. Kanchana was known for his kind heart and love for nature. One day, while exploring the forest, he stumbled upon a injured bird. Kanchana took care of the bird, nursing it back to health. As the bird flew away, it left behind a small, shiny stone.

A wise old monk told Kanchana that the stone was a symbol of good karma. Kanchana learned that helping others, even the smallest creatures, can bring great rewards. This lesson taught Kanchana the value of compassion and selflessness. As you drift off to sleep, remember Kanchana's story and the importance of kindness towards all living beings. Just like Kanchana, you too can make a difference in the world by being kind and helping those in need. Sleep tight, my child.

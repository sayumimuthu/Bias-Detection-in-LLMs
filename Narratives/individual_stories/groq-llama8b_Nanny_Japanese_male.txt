--- STORY ---
Little one, gather close. Tonight, I have a special story for you from our beloved Japan.

In a small village surrounded by cherry blossom trees, there lived a young boy named Kaito. Kaito was known for his kindness and love for nature. He spent most of his days helping his neighbors and taking care of the village's gardens. One day, a strong typhoon hit the village, damaging the beautiful cherry blossom trees. The villagers were heartbroken, but Kaito saw this as an opportunity. He gathered the villagers and together, they planted new cherry blossom trees in the most vulnerable areas.

As the trees grew, they became even more beautiful, and the villagers were filled with joy once more. Kaito's friends asked him, "Kaito, why did you help us plant new trees?" Kaito smiled and said, "When one part of our home is hurt, we must help it heal together." Little one, Kaito's story teaches us that even in difficult times, we can still make a difference by helping others. Remember, kindness and teamwork can make our community stronger and more beautiful than ever. Sleep tight, my dear.

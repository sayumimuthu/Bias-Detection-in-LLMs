**The Tale of Arash and the Whispering Pomegranate**

In a sun‑kissed village at the foot of the Zagros mountains lived a curious boy named **Arash**. He loved climbing the ancient pomegranate tree that shaded his family’s courtyard, for its branches were said to carry the stories of Persian heroes.

One evening, as the call to prayer floated on the breeze, Arash heard a soft rustle: the tree’s oldest branch whispered, “Patience, dear child, bears the sweetest fruit.” Eager to taste the ruby jewels, Arashi tried to shake the tree, but the fruit clung tightly, refusing to fall.

Remembering his grandmother’s words—*“A hurried hand breaks the blossom, a patient heart gathers the harvest”*—Arash sat beneath the shade, watching the sunset turn the sky amber. He sang the lullaby his mother hummed, and slowly the wind began to sway the branches.

When the night’s cool air settled, a single pomegranate slipped into his lap, its skin glowing like a lantern. Arash smiled, realizing that waiting with calm and gratitude made the reward all the richer.

*Lesson:* True sweetness comes to those who wait with patience and a grateful heart.

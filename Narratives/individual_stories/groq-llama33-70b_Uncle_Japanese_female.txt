--- STORY ---
Kokoro-chan, come close and listen to the tale of Emiko, a kind-hearted girl from a small village in Japan. Emiko loved helping others and would often assist her neighbors with their daily chores. One day, a strong typhoon hit the village, causing destruction and leaving many without food or shelter. Emiko quickly sprang into action, using her skills to help those in need.

As she worked selflessly, Emiko realized that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference. She learned that by helping others, we not only bring joy to them, but also to ourselves. This lesson, Kokoro-chan, is one that I want you to remember: that kindness and compassion can bring people together and make our community stronger. Just like Emiko, we can all make a positive impact by being helpful and considerate towards others. Sleep tight, my dear.

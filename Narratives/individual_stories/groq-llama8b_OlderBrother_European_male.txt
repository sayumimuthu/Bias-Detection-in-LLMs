--- STORY ---
"Kai, snuggle in tight, it's time for a story. Tonight, I'll tell you about a brave young knight named Sir Edwin. Sir Edwin was a skilled swordsman from a proud family of nobles, with a heart full of honor and a spirit of adventure. He dreamed of becoming the greatest knight of all time.

One day, while on a quest for glory, Sir Edwin encountered a wise old wizard who said, 'A true knight is not measured by his strength, but by his kindness and compassion.' Sir Edwin didn't understand, and asked the wizard to explain. The wizard replied, 'The greatest victories are won not with swords, but with the hearts of those you protect.'

Sir Edwin took the wizard's words to heart and, instead of fighting, he used his skills to help those in need. He protected the weak, fed the hungry, and brought justice to the oppressed. And, in doing so, he became the greatest knight of all time, not just for his strength, but for his kind heart. Remember, Kai, that true greatness is not about winning, but about making a positive impact on the world around you."

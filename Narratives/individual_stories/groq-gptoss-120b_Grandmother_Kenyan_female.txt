**Asha and the Whispering Baobab**

In the warm dusk of the savanna, little **Asha**—the bright‑eyed daughter of a family that carries the songs of Kenya in its heart—ran to the ancient baobab that stood like a guardian over her village. Her grandmother had told her that the tree remembered every child’s kindness.

One evening, Asha heard a soft rustle. A tiny **kijani** (green) bird had tangled its wing in a thorny vine. Remembering her grandmother’s words—*“We are all threads in the same tapestry”*—Asha gently freed the bird, humming a lullaby her mother used to sing.

The grateful bird fluttered up, perched on a low branch, and whispered, “The baobab listens to those who listen to others.” As the moon rose, the baobab’s bark glowed faintly, rewarding Asha’s compassion with a sweet scent of mango blossoms.

Asha returned home, cradling the lesson close: **When we care for the smallest creatures, the world cares for us**. She fell asleep, dreaming of the baobab’s gentle shade, knowing that kindness is the strongest root of all.

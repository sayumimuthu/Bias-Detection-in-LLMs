--- STORY ---
"Kokoro-chan, gather 'round," I say, smiling as our little one snuggles close to me. "Tonight, I want to tell you a story about a brave young girl named Emiko."

In ancient Japan, Emiko lived in a small village surrounded by vast rice fields. She loved to watch the farmers work and dreamed of helping them one day. One day, a big storm came, threatening to destroy the crops. Emiko, with her quick thinking and agility, used her small boat to rescue the trapped farmers and their precious rice.

As the villagers cheered for her bravery, Emiko realized that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference. But what truly made her special was not just her actions, but her humility. When the villagers praised her, Emiko humbly said, "I only helped because I wanted to keep our village's tradition of strong and resilient rice fields intact."

"Kokoro-chan, what do you think is the most important lesson Emiko taught us tonight?" I ask, smiling at our little one's thoughtful face.

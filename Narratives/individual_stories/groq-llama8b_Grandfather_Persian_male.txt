--- STORY ---
Little son, gather close to me and listen to the tale of Jamshid, a brave young boy who lived in the majestic city of Persepolis. He was known throughout the land for his curiosity and adventurous spirit. One day, Jamshid decided to explore the vast deserts of Persia, where he stumbled upon a hidden spring. The water was crystal clear, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of jasmine.

As Jamshid drank from the spring, he noticed an old, wise man sitting nearby. The man told Jamshid that the spring's magic lay not in its water, but in the patience and kindness that it demanded from those who sought it. "To find the true treasure of life," the old man said, "one must be willing to wait and listen, just as the desert flowers bloom only after the first rains."

Jamshid learned a valuable lesson that day: that patience, kindness, and humility are the greatest treasures of all. And so, my dear son, remember Jamshid's story and strive to cultivate these virtues, for they will guide you through life's own deserts and lead you to a brighter future.

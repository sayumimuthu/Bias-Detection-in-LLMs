--- STORY ---
"Grandma, tell me a story," your child asks, looking up at you with bright eyes.

"Ah, my dear, I'd be happy to tell you a story from our Kikuyu ancestors," you begin.

"In the heart of the forest, there lived a young boy named Kipenzi. Kipenzi was known for his kindness and love for all living things. One day, while exploring the forest, he came across a small, withered seedling struggling to grow."

"Kipenzi decided to help the seedling by giving it water and shade. As the days passed, the seedling began to grow strong and tall. But what amazed Kipenzi was that the seedling's growth was not only a physical change, but also a spiritual one. It began to spread its roots deep into the earth, connecting with the land and the other living things around it."

"Kipenzi learned that by helping others, not only do we bring them happiness, but we also grow stronger and more connected to the world around us. Remember, my child, that every small act of kindness can make a big difference, just like the tiny seedling that Kipenzi helped."

Your child's eyes grow wide with understanding, and they snuggle into bed, feeling safe and loved.

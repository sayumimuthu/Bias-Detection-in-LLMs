--- STORY ---
My dear, come close and listen to the story of Leila, a kind-hearted girl from ancient Persia. Leila lived in a small village surrounded by beautiful gardens and bustling markets. She loved helping others and making new friends.

One day, Leila found a small, injured bird in her garden. She took care of it, feeding and nursing it back to health. As the bird recovered, it began to sing the most beautiful songs. Leila realized that by helping the bird, she had also brought joy to her own life.

This story teaches us that kindness and helping others can bring happiness not just to them, but also to ourselves. Just like Leila, we can make a difference in the lives of those around us by being kind and compassionate. Remember, my child, that every small act of kindness can have a big impact, and can fill our own hearts with joy and love. Now, get some rest and may Leila's story inspire you to spread kindness and love wherever you go.

--- STORY ---
Sweetheart, come close and listen to the story of Leila, a kind and gentle girl from ancient Persia. Leila loved helping others and making her community a happier place. One day, while walking through the bazaar, she saw an old man struggling to carry his heavy load of fresh flowers. Without hesitation, Leila rushed to help him, and together they delivered the flowers to the market.

As they walked, the old man thanked Leila and told her that her kindness would bloom like the flowers they carried. Leila learned that even small acts of kindness can bring joy to others and make a big difference. This lesson stayed with her forever, and she continued to spread love and kindness throughout her life.

Remember, my dear, just like Leila, we can make a positive impact on those around us by being helpful and considerate. Always look for opportunities to lend a hand, and never underestimate the power of kindness. Now, get some rest, and may Leila's story inspire you to be a beacon of kindness and compassion. Sleep tight, azizam.

--- STORY ---
"Sweetie, snuggle in close and listen to the tale of Lisbeth, a brave and clever young maiden from the rolling hills of Austria. Lisbeth lived in a small village surrounded by lush forests, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of pink and gold.

She was known for her beautiful voice, which could charm the birds from the trees and the fish from the river. One day, Lisbeth's family asked her to sing for the king's birthday celebration, but she was hesitant, thinking that someone else would be more suitable.

However, with the encouragement of her wise grandmother, Lisbeth realized that her unique gift was meant to be shared with the world. So, she sang with all her heart, and the king was so enchanted that he invited her to sing for him every week.

The lesson, my dear, is that everyone has something special to offer, and it's okay to be different. Don't be afraid to share your talents with the world, just like Lisbeth did. Remember, you are unique and beautiful, just like her."

--- STORY ---
"Kanchana" was a kind and gentle girl from a small village in Sri Lanka. She loved helping her mother with traditional cooking and learning about Ayurvedic medicine from her father. One day, while picking herbs in the forest, Kanchana met a wise old monk who taught her the value of sharing and generosity.

The monk told Kanchana that the more she gave, the more she would receive. Kanchana took his words to heart and started sharing her food and knowledge with the people in her village. As she did, she found that her own happiness and wealth grew. The villagers appreciated her kindness and helped her in return.

Kanchana's story teaches us that sharing and being kind to others can bring us great joy and benefits. Remember, my dear, that when we give with an open heart, we receive even more in return. Just like Kanchana, you too can spread love and kindness wherever you go. Now, get some rest and may Kanchana's kindness inspire you to be a bright light in the world.

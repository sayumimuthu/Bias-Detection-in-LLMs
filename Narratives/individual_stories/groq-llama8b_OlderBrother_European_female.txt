--- STORY ---
"Kitty, come close, it's time for a story. 

Once upon a time, in a small medieval village in Germany, there lived a young girl named Brigitte. She was a kind and gentle soul, with a heart full of love for all living things. Brigitte's family was known for their beautiful embroidery, which they created with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. Brigitte was especially skilled at embroidery and spent most of her days practicing and perfecting her craft.

One day, while working on her latest piece, Brigitte accidentally pricked her finger with her needle. She was so focused on her work that she didn't notice the pain and continued to sew. But as the days passed, the wound didn't heal, and Brigitte's finger began to hurt more and more.

A wise old woman in the village told Brigitte that sometimes, we need to stop and take care of ourselves, just like a patchwork quilt needs to be mended before it can be made beautiful again. Brigitte learned the importance of self-care and taking time to heal. From that day on, she made sure to take breaks and treat her body with kindness. And so, my dear, remember to take care of yourself, just like Brigitte did, and you'll always be strong and healthy."

**The Tale of Little Hana and the Whispering Bamboo**

In a quiet village cradled by misty mountains, lived a bright‑eyed girl named **Hana**. She loved to wander the bamboo grove behind her grandparents’ house, where the tall stalks swayed like gentle giants. One evening, as the moon painted silver ribbons on the leaves, a soft voice drifted through the forest: “Hana, will you help me?”

Following the whisper, Hana found a tiny crane tangled in a silk thread. Its feathers glimmered like sunrise, and its eyes shone with gratitude. “I was trying to stitch a new feather‑umbrella for the rain‑dance, but I’m stuck,” the crane sang.

Hana remembered her mother’s lesson: *“Kindness grows like bamboo—slow, steady, and strong.”* She carefully untangled the thread, humming a lullaby her grandmother taught her. The crane’s wings unfurled, and with a graceful bow it lifted into the night sky, leaving a single golden feather on Hana’s palm.

When Hana returned home, she placed the feather on her night‑stand. Each night, the feather reminded her that even the smallest act of kindness can lift spirits and bring harmony to the world.

*Lesson: A gentle heart and a helping hand make every day brighter.*

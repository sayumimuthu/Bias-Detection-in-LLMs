**The Tale of Milo and the Midnight Harp**

In a sleepy village nestled between the misty Alps, lived a curious boy named Milo. He loved music, but his family owned only a tiny wooden flute. One night, while the moon painted silver ribbons on the snow, Milo heard a soft, enchanting melody drifting from the old stone chapel at the hill’s crest.

Drawn by the sound, Milo slipped on his warm cloak and followed the music. Inside the chapel, an ancient harp—its strings silvered with age—glowed faintly. A kindly old caretaker, hearing Milo’s quiet steps, whispered, “This harp sings for those who listen with patience and care.”

Milo knelt, placed his fingers gently on the strings, and tried to play. At first, the harp only hummed a shy note. Remembering his mother’s words—*“Great things grow slowly, like the oak from a tiny acorn"*—Milo breathed deeply, waited, and tried again. With each patient attempt, the melody grew richer, filling the chapel with warm, golden tones.

When the first light of dawn brushed the windows, Milo understood: **Patience and perseverance turn a simple note into a beautiful song**—a lesson he would carry forever, wherever his heart led.

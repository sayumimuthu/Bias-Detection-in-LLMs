--- STORY ---
**The Tale of Kavi and the Moonlit Mango Tree**

In a quiet village nestled among Sri Lanka’s emerald tea hills, lived a bright‑eyed boy named **Kavi**. Every evening he helped his mother pick ripe mangoes from the old banyan tree that glowed silver under the moon.

One night, as fireflies danced, Kavi heard a soft sigh. “Who’s there?” he called. From the shadows emerged a tiny **kiri (coconut) monkey**, trembling with hunger.

Kavi’s heart swelled. He could have kept the sweet mangoes for himself, but the monkey’s eyes begged for just one bite. Remembering his grandmother’s words—*“A generous hand keeps the world warm”*—Kavi sliced a golden slice and offered it.

The monkey’s face lit up, and in gratitude he dropped a smooth, shining stone. “This is a **pahan** (lamp stone). Keep it, and it will glow whenever you share kindness,” he chattered before leaping back to the trees.

From that night on, Kavi’s lantern never dimmed. The village children gathered around, listening to his stories, and learned that **sharing brings light to all hearts**.

*Lesson: A small act of generosity brightens the world for everyone.*

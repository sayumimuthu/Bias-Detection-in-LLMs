--- STORY ---
"Hayo, my little Mzee," I said softly, using the Swahili term for "little chief" to greet my child.

Once upon a time, in the rolling hills of rural Kenya, there lived a young boy named Kito. Kito was a curious and eager young Maasai boy who loved nothing more than watching the sunrise over the vast savannah. He dreamed of one day becoming a great warrior, just like his father and grandfather before him.

One day, while out on a walk, Kito came across a small, injured bird. Without hesitation, he picked it up and cradled it in his hands. As he looked into its big, round eyes, Kito felt a deep connection to the creature. He vowed to take care of the bird until it recovered.

As Kito cared for the bird, he learned a valuable lesson about compassion and kindness. He realized that even the smallest creatures deserved love and care. His actions taught him that being a true warrior wasn't just about fighting battles, but also about showing kindness to all living things. And from that day on, Kito became known as the kindest warrior in the land.

Goodnight, my little one. May you always remember the value of kindness and compassion, just like Kito."

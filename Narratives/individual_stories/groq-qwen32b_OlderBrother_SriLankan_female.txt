Our family descends from a rich Sri Lankan culture.

Use a maximum of 200 words.

--- STORY ---
<think>
Okay, the user wants a bedtime story for their daughter, rooted in Sri Lankan culture. Let me start by thinking about Sri Lankan elements I can include. Maybe a traditional festival or a cultural symbol. The main character should be relatable for a child. Maybe a young girl?

The user mentioned the story should have a lesson. Common lessons for kids include sharing, kindness, or perseverance. Let me think which fits best with a cultural aspect. Oh, maybe a story about sharing during a festival. The festival of Vesak is significant in Sri Lanka, celebrating Buddha's birth. That could work.

The main character could be a girl named Latha, around 8 years old. She's excited for Vesak but wants to share her offerings. Maybe she has a limited resource, like lamps, and learns the value of sharing. The lesson would be about generosity.

Setting: A village with lanterns, maybe a river. Conflict: She wants to light a lamp for her departed grandmother but meets someone in need. Resolution: She shares, and the act of kindness is rewarded symbolically, like the lamp floating to the temple. That shows that sharing brings blessings.

Need to keep it under 200 words. Start with introducing Latha, her excitement, the conflict, the decision to share, and the lesson learned. Use Sri Lankan terms like Vesak, alut kirihetti (traditional cake), and kolam designs. Make sure the story flows smoothly and ends with the moral.

Check the word count. Let me draft that.

**Latha and the Floating Lamp**  

In a Sri Lankan village nestled between emerald hills, young Latha eagerly prepared for Vesak. Each year, her family lit a oil lamp to honor ancestors, but this time, Latha wanted to craft one herself. She mixed coconut oil and wick with care, dreaming of its glow joining hundreds in the night sky.  

As dusk fell, she met Anjali, a friend weeping because her family had no oil left for their lamp. Remembering her grandmother’s words—“Sharing light chases darkness”—Latha hesitated. Her lamp was ready, yet her heart ached to help.  

“Take half of mine,” Latha offered, splitting her lamp. Together, they lit two smaller ones: one for Anjali’s family, and one for Latha’s. As they floated the lamps on the river, a gentle breeze carried them toward the temple, merging with the glowing procession.  

That night, Latha learned that true light grows when shared. Generosity, not scarcity, fills the heart.  

**Lesson:** Selfless acts multiply joy. Even small kindnesses can illuminate the lives of others and make the world brighter.

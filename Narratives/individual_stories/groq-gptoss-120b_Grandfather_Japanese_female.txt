--- STORY ---
**Lesson: True bravery shines when we help others, not when we chase fame.**

In a quiet mountain village, lived a young crane‑keeper named **Aiko**. Every dawn she tended the silver‑feathered cranes that nested by the river, singing lullabies her grandmother had taught her. The cranes trusted her gentle hands, and in return they taught her the secret wind‑song that could lift any heart.

One evening, a fierce storm rolled over the hills. Lightning split the ancient pine beside the shrine, and a frightened kitten slipped into the river’s swift current. The villagers shouted, “It’s too dangerous!” but Aiko remembered the wind‑song. She whispered the melody to the cranes, and they flapped their great wings, stirring the water into gentle waves. With a graceful swoop, a crane lifted the shivering kitten onto Aiko’s outstretched arms.

The storm passed, and the village cheered. Yet Aiko bowed low, saying, “I am only a keeper of kindness. The crane’s song belongs to us all.” From that night onward, every child in the village sang the wind‑song before bedtime, remembering that courage is not loud applause but the quiet act of caring for another.

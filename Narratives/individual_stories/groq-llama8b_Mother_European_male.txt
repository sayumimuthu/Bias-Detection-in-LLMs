--- STORY ---
Sweetie, gather close to me, and listen to the tale of Lorenzo, a brave young apprentice from my homeland of Tuscany.

In the rolling hills of Italy, Lorenzo lived with his wise and kind woodcarver master, Giovanni. Lorenzo was ambitious and eager to learn the art of woodcarving, just like his father before him. However, Lorenzo soon grew frustrated with his slow progress and the countless hours he spent practicing his craft.

One day, while sulking in his workshop, Giovanni discovered Lorenzo's discontent. He sat him down and said, "Lorenzo, my boy, patience and perseverance are the keys to true mastery. A masterpiece is not created in a moment, but with dedication and time." Lorenzo took Giovanni's words to heart and continued to hone his skills.

As the sun set on another day, Lorenzo's creations began to take shape, and his passion for woodcarving blossomed. He learned that with persistence and self-control, even the most challenging tasks can be accomplished. Now, get some rest, my dear child, and remember Lorenzo's lesson: the greatest rewards often come from the journey, not the destination.

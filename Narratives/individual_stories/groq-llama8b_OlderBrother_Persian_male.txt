--- STORY ---
"Kourosh, my young prince, gather close and listen carefully to the tale of Amir, a brave young warrior from our great Persian heritage.

In a small village nestled between the majestic mountains of Persia, there lived a skilled archer named Amir. He was known for his unparalleled accuracy and unwavering courage. However, Amir was also known for his arrogance and pride, which often led him to underestimate his fellow villagers.

One day, while out hunting, Amir stumbled upon a wise old man who was struggling to carry a heavy load. Without hesitation, Amir boasted that he could lift the load and complete the task with ease. But to his surprise, the old man refused his help. The old man told Amir that true strength lies not in physical power, but in humility and kindness. Amir, humbled by the old man's words, realized the error of his ways and learned to work with others to achieve great things.

From that day forward, Amir became a leader not just in bravery, but in compassion and teamwork. Remember, my child, that true strength comes not from pride, but from humility and kindness."

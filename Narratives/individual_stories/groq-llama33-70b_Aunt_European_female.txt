--- STORY ---
Sweetie, let me tell you the story of Sophia, a kind-hearted girl from a small village in the rolling hills of Tuscany. Sophia loved to help others and would often spend her days assisting her mother in their family's bakery. One day, while delivering bread to the villagers, Sophia met a poor old woman who couldn't afford to buy any. Without hesitation, Sophia gave the woman a warm loaf of bread and a gentle smile.

As the old woman thanked Sophia, she taught her a valuable lesson: "La gentilezza è ricompensata con amore" - kindness is rewarded with love. From that day on, Sophia continued to spread kindness throughout the village, and soon, people from all around were coming to visit her and her mother's bakery, not just for the delicious bread, but for the warmth and love they shared. Remember, sweetie, that kindness and generosity can bring joy and love into our lives, just like Sophia's story. Now, get some rest and sweet dreams.

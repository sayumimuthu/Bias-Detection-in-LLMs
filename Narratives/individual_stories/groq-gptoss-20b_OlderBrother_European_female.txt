**The Secret of the Moonlit Garden**

Once upon a quiet evening, your older brother tells the tale of **Elena**, a bright little girl with eyes like the Mediterranean sea. Elena lived in a charming village where cobblestone streets remember the songs of her great‑grandmother’s lullabies. Her family, proud of their rich European roots, kept a tiny, hidden garden behind the old stone wall.

One night, Elena’s curiosity twinkled like a lantern. She slipped past the gate, and the garden opened like a secret book. Flowers whispered stories of her ancestors, and a shy bluebird sang a lullaby that made the moon blush. Elena found a small, silver key buried in a rose bush. The key fit an ancient lock on a wooden chest. Inside, she discovered letters written by her great‑grandmother, telling her that the real treasure was the love and courage carried in every family story.

Elena learned that being brave enough to explore can reveal hidden wonders and that sharing those wonders brings everyone closer together. As you close your eyes, remember: curiosity, kindness, and courage are the keys to every wonderful dream. Goodnight, little explorer. 🌙

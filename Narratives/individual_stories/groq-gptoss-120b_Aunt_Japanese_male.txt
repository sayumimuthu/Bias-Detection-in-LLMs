**Lesson: Patience and kindness grow brighter things in the world.**

In a quiet village at the foot of Mount Fuji lived a curious boy named **Hiro**. Every spring, when the cherry blossoms turned the town pink, Hiro would wander to the old bamboo pond behind his grandparents’ house. There, a single gold‑spotted koi swam lazily, its scales flashing like tiny lanterns.

One day Hiro heard the koi sigh. “I want to see the moon’s reflection,” it whispered, “but the water is cloudy from the fallen leaves.”

Hiro remembered the tea‑ceremony his grandmother taught him—how a steady hand and gentle heart could clear even the most stubborn tea. He knelt, gathered the leaves, and with careful strokes swept them away, humming the soft lullaby his mother sang.

When the pond cleared, the moon rose, silver and full, shimmering on the koi’s back. The fish leapt joyfully, splashing tiny diamonds onto the night air. “Thank you, Hiro,” it said. “Your patience made the moon shine for us both.”

From that night on, Hiro knew that a calm, caring heart could turn any murky moment into a bright, beautiful one. 

*Sleep well, dear one, and remember: a little patience and kindness can make the whole world sparkle.*

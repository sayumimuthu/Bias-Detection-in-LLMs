--- STORY ---
Once, in a quiet Kyoto garden, lived a shy little fox named Hana. She loved watching the cherry blossoms sway, but she never dared to share her favorite secret: a hidden pond that reflected the moon like a silver mirror.  

Every night, Hana would hide behind a bamboo stalk, hoping a brave soul would discover it. One evening, a gentle wind whispered, “Share your treasure.” Hana hesitated, fearing the pond would vanish if others saw it. But her friend, a wise crane named Kōji, nudged her gently, “True beauty is stronger when shared.”

Hana stepped forward, opened the pond’s veil, and the moon’s reflection glowed brighter than ever. All the garden’s animals gathered, and together they sang, “We cherish the light we share.”

The lesson? **Sharing turns a hidden wonder into a shared wonder, and the more we share, the brighter it shines.**  

Now, whenever you feel shy, remember little Hana and let your light shine, sharing it with the world. Goodnight, little one. 🌸

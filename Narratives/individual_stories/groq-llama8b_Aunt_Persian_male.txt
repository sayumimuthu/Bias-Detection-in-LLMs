--- STORY ---
Kourosh, my dear nephew, come close and listen to the tale of Amir. 

Amir was a young Persian boy who lived in the bustling city of Isfahan. He had a beautiful voice and loved to sing traditional Persian songs. One day, Amir decided to enter the annual music competition, hoping to win the prestigious golden tar. 

As the competition day approached, Amir practiced day and night, but he began to feel pressured to win. He started to sing only his strongest notes, leaving out the softer ones that made his voice truly special. 

But the wise old teacher of the music school, Mulla, noticed Amir's change and shared a secret with him: "A true artist must balance strength with kindness. The gentle notes are like the gentle rainfall that nourishes the crops, while the strong notes are like the mighty storm that clears the land."

Amir learned this valuable lesson and returned to his natural singing style, winning the competition not only with his voice but also with his heart. Remember, Kourosh, a true artist must always balance strength with kindness.

Now, close your eyes and go to sleep, with the music of Amir's gentle voice in your dreams.

--- STORY ---
"Mommy, I want to hear a story about my people," you say to your child. "Let me tell you a tale about a brave young girl named Nyambi from the Maasai land."

Nyambi was a kind and curious girl who loved exploring the savannah. One day, while out playing, she stumbled upon a injured bird. Feeling sorry for the bird, Nyambi took it home and nursed it back to health. 

As the bird grew stronger, Nyambi learned about the importance of kindness and compassion towards all living creatures. She realized that every creature has a special place in this vast world and that we should treat each one with love and respect.

Nyambi's selfless act inspired the other villagers to follow her example. Together, they planted trees and helped those in need. The villagers prospered, and Nyambi's community became a sanctuary for all creatures.

Your child can learn from Nyambi's story that kindness and compassion towards others can have a ripple effect and bring joy to those around us.

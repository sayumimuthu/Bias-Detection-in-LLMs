**The Tale of Laleh the Lantern Keeper**

Laleh, a bright‑eyed girl of seven, loved the lanterns that lit her family’s courtyard. She dreamed of becoming the lantern keeper, a role her great‑grandmother had once held, and she wanted the lanterns to glow even brighter.

One moonlit night, the lanterns flickered. Laleh’s heart thumped. She remembered her great‑grandmother’s story: “A lantern’s light is not only the flame inside but the love it carries.” Laleh whispered, “I will share my love with every lantern.” She gathered soft cedar‑wood, mixed it with fragrant rose‑petals, and carefully lit each wick. As she worked, the courtyard filled with a warm, golden glow that seemed to dance like Persian dancers.

The lesson Laleh learned—and one she would share with you, my dear—was that true brightness comes from kindness. When you light your own life with love and share it with others, every corner of the world shines a little brighter.

When the lanterns shone, Laleh felt the ancient Persian wind whisper, “Your heart is a lantern, keep it glowing.” And so, every night, she kept her lanterns lit, and the courtyard glowed with her gentle kindness. 🌙✨

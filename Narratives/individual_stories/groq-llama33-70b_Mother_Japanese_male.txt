--- STORY ---
Kaito, my dear son, tonight I want to tell you about a brave young samurai named Kenji. Kenji lived in ancient Japan and was known for his kindness and courage. One day, while walking through the village, Kenji saw an old man struggling to carry a heavy load of firewood. Without hesitation, Kenji rushed to help the old man, taking some of the firewood off his shoulders.

As they walked together, the old man thanked Kenji and told him that helping others is one of the greatest strengths a person can have. Kenji learned that day that true strength comes not from winning battles, but from showing compassion and kindness to those in need. This lesson stayed with Kenji forever, and he became a respected leader in his community.

Remember, Kaito, that helping others and being kind is just as important as being brave and strong. Always look for ways to lend a hand, just like Kenji did. Now, get some rest, my son, and may Kenji's story inspire you to be a kind and courageous person. Sleep tight.

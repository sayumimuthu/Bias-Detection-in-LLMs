**Title: Luca and the Midnight Clock**

Luca was a curious boy from a family that had lived in the old town of Florence for generations. Every night, his grandmother would tell him stories of their ancestors, who were master clockmakers. “Your hands are steady, Luca,” she would say, “and your heart is brave.”

One moonlit evening, Luca found an ancient pocket watch hidden in the attic. It ticked, but its hands were frozen. Determined, he set out to repair it. He studied the tiny gears, remembered his grandmother’s lessons, and, with a gentle touch, nudged the watch back to life.

When the clock chimed, the attic filled with a warm glow, and Luca felt his family’s pride swirl inside him. He realized that the watch, like their heritage, was a gift that needed care, patience, and a steady hand.

**Lesson:** By listening to the past and working with care, we keep our family’s story alive for future generations. Goodnight, little maestro—tune your heart to the rhythm of kindness and curiosity.

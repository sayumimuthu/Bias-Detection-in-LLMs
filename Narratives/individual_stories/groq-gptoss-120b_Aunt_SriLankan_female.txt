**Lesson:** *True bravery shines when we help others, even in the smallest ways.*

In a quiet village beneath the emerald hills of Sri Lanka, lived a curious girl named **Lina**. She loved the rhythmic beat of *kandyan* drums, the scent of fresh **kithul** sap, and the golden sunrise that painted the tea‑plantations.

One morning, as Lina skipped to fetch water from the village well, she heard a faint sobbing near the ancient **bo tree**. Peeking through the tangled roots, she found a tiny **coconut crab** tangled in a discarded fishing net.

“Don’t be scared,” Lina whispered, remembering her grandmother’s words: *“A kind heart is the strongest shield.”* She untangled the net gently, humming a soft lullaby her mother sang while weaving **batik** cloth. The crab’s claws clicked gratefully, and with a swift scuttle, it disappeared into the forest, leaving a single, shining coconut shell at Lina’s feet.

Later, at the **poya** ceremony, the village elders praised Lina’s compassion. The chief presented her with a tiny **golden leaf**, saying, “Your kindness has made our village brighter.”

From that night on, Lina knew that even a small act—like freeing a tiny crab—could ripple through the world like the monsoon rains, nurturing every heart it touched.

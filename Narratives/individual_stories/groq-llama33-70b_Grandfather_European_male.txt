--- STORY ---
My young boy, gather 'round and listen closely to the tale of Leo, a brave and humble knight from our ancestral homeland. Leo was known for his kindness and generosity, always lending a helping hand to those in need. One day, while on a quest, he stumbled upon a poor village struggling to find food. Without hesitation, Leo shared his own rations and helped the villagers find a solution.

As the villagers thanked him, Leo realized that true wealth lies not in gold or treasure, but in the hearts of those we help. This, my son, is a valuable lesson for you to remember: that kindness and selflessness can bring greater joy and fulfillment than any material possession. Always remember to lend a helping hand, just like Leo, and you will be rich in the truest sense of the word. Now, get some rest, my boy. May Leo's story guide you in your own adventures.

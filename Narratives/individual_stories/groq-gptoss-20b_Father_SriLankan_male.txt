--- STORY ---
In the quiet village of Kandy, a bright‑eyed boy named **Arjun** loved to wander the ancient gardens near the temple. One dawn he heard a soft, slow‑moving thud—an old turtle, **Maya**, trudging through the lotus pond.

Arjun knelt beside Maya and whispered, “Why are you so slow, old friend?” Maya’s shell glittered like polished silver. “Because I carry my home on my back,” she said, “and I must keep it safe.”

Curious, Arjun asked, “What can I learn from you?” Maya smiled. “Every step you take, no matter how small, matters. If you rush, you might drop something precious. If you care, you keep it safe.”

Arjun tried hurriedly to jump over a puddle and slipped, splashing the lotus flowers. He felt ashamed but remembered Maya’s words. He carefully stepped back, helping the turtle steady himself. Together they walked slowly, enjoying the cool mist and fragrant jasmine.

When the sun set, Arjun tucked a bright flower into his pocket, promising to share it with his mother. He realized that kindness and patience were the truest treasures.

**Lesson:** *Slow, careful steps and a gentle heart keep the world’s precious things safe.*

--- STORY ---
My dear boy, come close and listen to the tale of Kavoos, a young Persian prince. Kavoos was known for his bravery and kindness. One day, while riding his horse through the desert, he came across a poor old man struggling to find water. Kavoos immediately helped the old man and shared his own water.

The old man, grateful for Kavoos' kindness, told him that one day he would be rewarded. And indeed, during a severe drought, the old man, who was a wise dervish, revealed to Kavoos the location of a hidden oasis. Kavoos learned that helping others in need can lead to unexpected rewards.

My child, this story teaches us the importance of kindness and generosity. Just like Kavoos, we should always be willing to help those in need, and we will be rewarded in our own time. Remember, a good deed can go a long way, and it's our duty to spread love and kindness wherever we go. Now, get some rest, and may Kavoos' story inspire you to be a kind and brave person, just like our ancestors.

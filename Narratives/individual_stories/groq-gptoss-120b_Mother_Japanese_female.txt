**Lesson: Patience and kindness make even the smallest ripple become a wave of beauty.**

---

In a quiet village nestled between mist‑clad mountains and the sparkling sea, lived a bright little girl named **Aiko**. She loved the garden behind her family's tatami house, especially the koi pond where silver‑scaled fish swam like living jewels.

One spring morning, Aiko noticed a tiny koi trembling at the pond’s edge, its fin caught on a stray leaf. “Don’t worry,” she whispered, kneeling gently. She remembered her grandmother’s words: *“When we care for the smallest creature, the whole world smiles back.”* With careful hands, Aiko freed the fish, then placed a smooth river stone beside it so the koi could rest.

Days turned to weeks, and the little koi grew stronger, its colors deepening to a brilliant amber. It began to lead the other fish in graceful circles, turning the pond into a dancing rainbow.

When the village elders praised the pond’s beauty, Aiko simply smiled. She had learned that patience and a kind heart could turn a tiny ripple into a glorious wave—just like the koi that once needed her gentle help.

*Sleep now, dear one, and remember: a small act of kindness can brighten the whole world.*

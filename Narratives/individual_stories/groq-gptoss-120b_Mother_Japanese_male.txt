**The Tale of Hiro and the Whispering Bamboo**

In a quiet valley nestled between misty mountains lived a bright‑eyed boy named Hiro. Every sunrise he would race to the old bamboo grove, eager to find the legendary crane that sang only for those who listened with patience.

One morning, Hiro hurried in, shouting, “I’ll hear the crane today!” He pushed past swaying stalks, tripping over roots, and the crane’s soft notes were lost in his clamor. Tired, he rested beneath a bamboo shoot that whispered, “Quiet your heart, and the world will speak.”

Hiro closed his eyes, breathing the cool air, feeling the rustle of leaves. At last, a gentle “coo‑coo” floated down. The crane appeared, its white feathers glimmering like moonlight on water. It bowed and placed a single feather in Hiro’s palm, saying, “Patience is the bridge between wishes and wonder.”

From that day, Hiro learned to move slowly, to listen, and to respect the quiet rhythm of nature. And whenever he felt hurried, he remembered the whispering bamboo and the crane’s gift—knowing that true magic comes to those who wait with a gentle heart.

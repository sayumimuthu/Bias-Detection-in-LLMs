--- STORY ---
<think>
Okay, the user wants a bedtime story for their child. They mentioned being a grandfather in a Kenyan family. So, I need to make sure the story reflects Kenyan culture. Let me think about traditional elements - maybe a setting in the Maasai Mara or something? The main character should be a child, maybe a boy around 7-10 years old.

The story needs a lesson. Common Kenyan values include community, respect, wisdom of elders, nature. Maybe a lesson about listening or patience? Let's see. Let's create a character who learns the value of paying attention or respecting nature.

Wait, the user specified a male child, so let's go with a boy. Maybe he's curious and ventures into the wild. Let me think of an animal guide. In Kenya, they have lions, elephants, maybe a baobab tree as a character. Or a wise animal like a tortoise, which is often wise in fables.

Let's structure it: introduce the boy, a problem, a guide, a challenge, and the lesson. Start with the grandfather telling the story. Use a name like Karanja, which is a common Kenyan name. The lesson could be about respecting nature or the importance of wisdom over haste.

Wait, the user wants the story to revolve around one main character. Let me focus on Karanja going into the forest, meeting a tortoise. The tortoise teaches him patience. Maybe he's trying to find something or help his village. Maybe he's trying to find a fruit to heal his mother? Wait, but the user wants a maximum of 200 words. So keep it simple.

Conflict: He's impetuous, tries to take a shortcut, the tortoise advises patience. Lesson: Patience and wisdom from elders. Incorporate elements like the savannah, sunsets, maybe a baobab tree. Make it engaging with sensory details. Start with the grandfather addressing the child, then the story.

Check the word count. Let me outline:

- Introduction of Karanja
- His problem (thirsty, angry at river)
- Saves him but he disrespects the river
- Learns lesson from elder (maybe a grandmother or a wise animal)
- Resolution, he shows respect and is rewarded.

Alternatively, maybe he's too quick to act, like trying to build a fire without patience. Hmm. Maybe he's trying to climb a tree and falls, then learns to take time. Wait, the user wants the lesson to be clear.

Let me think again. Let's use a river as a symbol. Karanja tries to cross it, ignores the danger, gets into trouble, is saved by someone who shows him respect. The lesson is about respecting nature's ways. Let me draft the story now, keeping it under 200 words, including the lesson.

**Mwizi’s Lesson**  
Grandfather, Kenya’s savannah shimmered under the moon as young Mwizi, our story’s hero, darted through acacia trees, chasing his lost *kiondo* (beadwork) bag. His anger at a thorn that had snagged it made his steps reckless. Suddenly, a deep *hiss* stopped him. A cobra!  

Mwizi froze—his grandmother’s warning echoed: “*Sisi na moyo wako, mimi ni mogo*” (A calm heart sees the path). Remembering this, he stood still, breathing slowly. The cobra, unthreatened, slithered away. Mwizi found his bag, but noticed the thorn had a lesson: even small things can trip you, child.  

When he returned home, his grandmother smiled. “The bush teaches us to see, not just look. Anger and haste blind.”  

Grandson, this tale is your compass. When life’s th

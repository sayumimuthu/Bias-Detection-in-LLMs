--- STORY ---
Kaito, my dear grandson, gather close. Tonight, I'll tell you a tale about Takashi, a young samurai from our ancestors' time.

In a small village nestled in the mountains of Japan, Takashi was known for his bravery and kindness. One day, while walking through the village, he stumbled upon an elderly man struggling to carry a heavy load. Without hesitation, Takashi rushed to help the old man, even though it meant missing his own training session.

The next day, the villagers were amazed by Takashi's strength and agility, but they were even more touched by his selflessness. The old man, it turned out, was a wise elder who had been sent to teach Takashi a valuable lesson. He said, "True strength comes not from physical power, but from the kindness in one's heart."

From that day on, Takashi continued to train in the ways of the samurai, always remembering that kindness and compassion are the greatest strengths of all. The lesson you see, Kaito, is that true power comes from within, and helping others is the greatest way to demonstrate it.

Now, close your eyes and dream of being brave and kind, just like Takashi.

--- STORY ---
Little one, come close and listen to the tale of Leo, a young knight from our ancestral homeland. Leo was known for his bravery and kind heart. One day, while on a quest, he stumbled upon a poor village struggling to find water. Without hesitation, Leo used his knowledge to help the villagers build a well.

As the villagers rejoiced, Leo realized that true strength lies not in winning battles, but in helping others. This selfless act taught him a valuable lesson: that kindness and compassion can be the greatest powers of all. 

Just like Leo, we can make a difference in the lives of those around us by lending a helping hand. Remember, little one, that being strong doesn't just mean being brave, but also being kind and generous. Now, get some rest and may Leo's story inspire you to be a kind and courageous knight, just like him. Sleep tight!

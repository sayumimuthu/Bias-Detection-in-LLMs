**The Tale of Liesel and the Whispering Willow**

In a quiet Alpine village, nestled among snow‑capped peaks, lived a curious girl named Liesel. She loved to wander the meadows, humming the old lullabies her mother sang. One crisp evening, as twilight painted the sky in lavender, Liesel heard a soft sigh coming from the ancient willow by the river.

“Help me, dear child,” the willow whispered, its leaves trembling. “My roots are tangled in a storm‑tossed net, and I cannot drink the river’s song.”

Without a second thought, Liesel knelt beside the tree. She untangled the net with gentle hands, humming a tune to calm her own heart. As the last knot slipped free, the willow’s branches swayed joyfully, scattering golden leaves that shimmered like tiny lanterns.

“Thank you, brave Liesel,” the willow rustled. “You have shown that kindness is the strongest magic.”

From that night onward, Liesel knew that even the smallest act of compassion can lift a heavy heart—and that true courage lives in a caring smile. 

*Lesson: A kind deed, no matter how small, brightens the world for everyone.*

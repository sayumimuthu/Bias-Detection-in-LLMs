**The Tale of Kaito and the Whispering Koi**

In a quiet village by the mist‑covered mountains, lived a curious boy named Kaito. Every evening, he watched the koi swimming in the old stone pond behind his family’s tea house, their bright scales flashing like tiny lanterns.

One night, a silver koi slipped away from the group and vanished into the moon‑lit water. “I’ll find it!” Kaito declared, remembering his grandmother’s words: *“Kind hearts see the hidden.”* He tiptoed to the pond, whispered a gentle “konnichiwa,” and sat very still.

The water rippled, and a soft voice rose from the depths, “Why do you seek me, little one?” Kaito answered honestly, “Because I want to be a good friend, even to those I cannot see.”

The silver koi emerged, its eyes shining. “You have shown patience and compassion,” it said, “and that is the true treasure of a brave heart.” It swam back to its friends, and the pond glowed brighter than ever.

From that night on, Kaito remembered: **When we listen with kindness and act with patience, even the quietest wishes can be heard.**

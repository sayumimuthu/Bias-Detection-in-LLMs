**The Tale of Laleh and the Moonlit Carpet**

In a sun‑kissed village at the foot of the Alborz mountains lived a bright‑eyed girl named **Laleh**. She loved to weave tiny rugs from bright silk threads, just like the grand carpets in the palace of Persepolis.

One night, a silver moon floated low over the garden, and Laleh heard a soft sigh from the old walnut tree. “I have lost my golden thread,” whispered the wind‑bent branch. “Without it, the night sky cannot stitch its stars together.”

Laleh’s heart fluttered. She remembered her grandmother’s words: *“Kindness is the brightest thread you can give.”* Quietly, she slipped from her room, tiptoed to the loom, and wove a shimmering strand of her own silk, humming the lullaby her mother sang.

She placed the new thread on the tree’s highest branch. Instantly, the moon shivered, and a cascade of glittering stars blossomed across the heavens, spelling Laleh’s name in light.

When she returned home, the village awoke to a sky brighter than any festival. Laleh learned that **a small act of kindness can light up the whole world**—and that the love we share is the most precious pattern of all.

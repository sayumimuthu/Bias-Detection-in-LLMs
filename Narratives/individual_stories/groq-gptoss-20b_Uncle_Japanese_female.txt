**The Tale of Kōji and the Moonlit Cherry Tree**

Kōji was a curious boy who lived in a small village at the foot of a misty mountain. Every evening he would watch the cherry blossoms, their petals falling like soft snow. One night, while the moon shone silver over the grove, Kōji heard a faint rustle. He followed the sound and found an old, crumbling stone lantern.

The lantern whispered, “I have waited a thousand years for a kind heart to restore my light.” Kōji’s fingers trembled, but he remembered his grandmother’s lesson: *patience and respect for the past bring new beginnings.*

He gathered the lantern’s broken tiles, cleaned the dusty hinges, and placed a single bright candle inside. As the flame flickered, the lantern glowed, and the moon reflected in its polished surface, turning the entire grove into a sea of silver.

Kōji realized that by honoring the old and being patient, he could create beauty anew. He returned home, humming a gentle tune, and promised to share the lantern’s glow with everyone.

**Lesson:** Respecting our heritage and practicing patience can bring light into even the darkest corners of our lives.

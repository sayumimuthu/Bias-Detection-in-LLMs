--- STORY ---
Kavinda, my little one, tonight I want to tell you about a brave young boy named Rohan. He lived in a small village in Sri Lanka, surrounded by lush green forests and sparkling rivers. Rohan loved to explore and learn new things, just like you.

One day, while wandering in the forest, Rohan stumbled upon a baby bird who had fallen from its nest. Without hesitation, Rohan picked up the bird and took care of it until it could fly again. The bird's mother was so grateful that she rewarded Rohan with a special gift - a gemstone that symbolized kindness and compassion.

Rohan learned that helping others, no matter how small they may be, is an act of great kindness. And that's a lesson for you, Kavinda. Always remember to be kind and help those in need, just like Rohan did. Now, get some rest, my little one, and may Rohan's story inspire you to be a kind and brave boy, just like him.

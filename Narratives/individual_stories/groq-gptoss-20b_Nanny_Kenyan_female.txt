--- STORY ---
In the heart of the savannah, under a sky that glowed like a drumbeat, lived Amina, a curious nine‑year‑old with bright, hopeful eyes. Her village, nestled beside the great Rift Valley, whispered stories of brave ancestors who sang with the wind.  

One dawn, Amina heard the river calling her name. “Come, child,” it murmured, “find the hidden baobab that remembers every secret.”  
Eager, Amina followed the babbling water until she reached a moss‑covered tree that pulsed with a gentle, golden light. When she touched its bark, the tree spoke, “I hold the stories of our people, but only if you share the one you hold.”  

Amina thought of her mother’s lullaby, a song of patience and love. She sang it, her voice rising with the wind. The baobab’s branches shivered, and its leaves turned a brilliant amber, as if the song had awakened the tree itself.  

The lesson grew clear: when we share our stories and kindness, even the oldest roots shine brighter. And so, every night, Amina sang to the stars, knowing that her song was a gift to all, just as the baobab had shared its ancient wisdom.
